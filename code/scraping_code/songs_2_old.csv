All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said show me something
He said, ""If you dare come a little closer""
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

[Hook: Rihanna]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Verse 2: Mikky Ekko]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

[Hook: Mikky Ekko]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Bridge: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]
The reason I hold on
Cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

[Hook: Rihanna & Mikky Ekko]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh"

Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha

[Intro: T.I.]
Ay... this a special what's happenin to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin at what you ain't got
Start bein thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

[Hook: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin my life

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein gracious they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Hook: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
[You steady chasin that paper]
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin my life

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin and the hollerin, back and forth with the arguin
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Hook: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin that paper
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin my life

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin your paper, and keep on climbin
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin (shinin)
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin my life, my liiiife
And I'll never stop it

[Sample]

Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(I'm going crazy now...)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

[Verse 1]
No more gas, in the red
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
All my life on my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
It's too close for comfort

[Chorus]
Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise
