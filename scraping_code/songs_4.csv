0,Careless Whisper,Wham! featuring George Michael,Wham! featuring,Careless Whisper Wham! featuring,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

[Verse 2]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all that you'll find

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

[Post-Chorus]
Never without your love

[Bridge]
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay, and...

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you

[Outro]
Now that you're gone, now that you're gone
Now that you're gone, was what I did so wrong, so wrong
That you had to leave me alone?"
1,Like a Virgin,Madonna,Madonna,Like a Virgin Madonna,"[Verse 1]
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didn't know how lost I was until I found you
I was beat, incomplete, I'd been had
I was sad and blue, but you made me feel
Yeah, you made me feel shiny and new

[Chorus 1]
Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
When your heart beats next to mine

[Verse 2]
Gonna give you all my love, boy
My fear is fading fast
Been saving it all for you, 'cause only love can last
You're so fine and you're mine
Make me strong, yeah, you make me bold
Oh, your love thawed out
Yeah, your love thawed out what was scared and cold

[Chorus 2]
Like a virgin (hey)
Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

Touched for the very first time
Like a virgin
With your heartbeat next to mine

When you hold me, and your heart beats, and you love me
Ooh, baby yeah
Can't you hear my heart beat for the very first time?"

Jitterbug
Jitterbug

You put the boom boom into my heart
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
Jitterbug into my brain
Goes a bang-bang-bang 'til my feet do the same
But something's bugging you
Something ain't right
My best friend told me what you did last night
Left me sleepin' in my bed
I was dreaming, but I should have been with you instead

[Hook]
Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go
Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You take the grey skies out of my way
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
Turned a bright spark into a flame
My beats per minute never been the same
Cause you're my lady, I'm your fool
It makes me crazy when you act so cruel
Come on, baby, let's not fight
We'll go dancing, everything will be all right

[Hook 2]

Cuddle up, baby, move in tight
We'll go dancing tomorrow night
It's cold out there, but it's warm in bed
They can dance, we'll stay home instead"

I got to take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like a world upon my shoulders
I through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

[Pre-Chorus]
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I want to know what love is
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is
I know you can show me

A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far

5,Out of Touch,Hall & Oates,Hall &,Out of Touch Hall &,"[Verse 1]
Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

[Chorus x2]
You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around

[Verse 2]
Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't
Use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much

[Chorus (repeat)]"

There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you
Acting on your best behaviour
Turn your back on mother nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own design
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most
Of freedom and of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do I'll be right behind you

So glad we've almost made it
So sad they had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I can't stand this indecision
Married with a lack of vision

All for freedom and for pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever

Swaying room as the music starts
Strangers making the most of the dark
Two by two their bodies become one

I see you through the smokey air
Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

Trying hard to control my heart
I walk over to where you are
Eye to eye we need no words at all

Oh I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

[Pre-Chorus]
And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

[Chorus]
And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

[Verse 2]
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
Cause you take me to the places
That alone I'd never find

[Pre-Chorus]
And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore"

It's just another Sunday, in a tired old street
Police have got the choke hold, oh then we just lost the beat

Who counts the money underneath the bar
Who rides the wrecking ball in to our rock guitars
Don't tell us you need us, 'cos we're the ship of fools
Looking for America, coming through your schools

(I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge
Out on another gorgeous sunny Saturday, not seeing that bumper to bumper traffic)

Don't you remember, 'member, 'member

(It's your favorite radio station, in your favorite radio city
The city by the bay, the city that rocks, the city that never sleeps)

Marconi plays the mamba, listen to the radio, don't you remember
We built this city, we built this city on rock and roll

14,The Power of Love,Huey Lewis and the News,Huey Lewis,The Power of Love Huey Lewis,"[Verse 1]
The power of love is a curious thing
Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a hawk to a little white dove
More than a feeling that's the power of love
Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good make a wrong one right
Power of love that keeps you home at night

[Chorus]
You don't need money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life
That's the power of love
That's the power of love

[Verse 2]
First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power makes the world go'round

[Second Chorus]
And it don't take money, don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

[Bridge]
They say that all in love is fair
Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do
When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Can you feel it?
Hmmm

[Outro]
It don't take money and it don't take fame
Don't need no credit card to ride this train
Tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
You won't feel nothin' till you feel
You feel the power, just feel the power of love
That's the power, that's the power of love
You feel the power of love
You feel the power of love
Feel the power of love"

There was a time I used to look into my father's eyes
In a happy home I was a king I had a golden throne
Those days are gone, now the memories are on the wall
I hear the songs from the places where I was born

Hand in hand, you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given

I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (oh)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side

I often pray before I lay down by your side
And if you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night?

Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live (Baby, yeah)
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love

Cherish the love we have

When I start to care, then I find there is no one there
But I think of you and I know we are something new
We get high and higher, crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love so sharp and flat, that it's hard to know just where you at, where you at

We get higher and higher, crazy blue, like St. Elmo's fire
Love so sharp and flat, that it's hard to know just where you're at

Stimulate your mind, girl, it's Friday you ain't got shit to do
I put you on some real shit if you ain't scared to to take a hit or two
Stay away from that reggie, can't deal with the middle men
Who gives a fuck if he keep em clean, you can't ride on them lil' 10's
They say they got it, they ain't got it, they don't seem to feel no guilt
Got peanut butter, but no jelly, got cereal, but no milk
Where I'm from that's a half ass nigga, half of the time ole ""half past"" nigga
Mad cause they can't get down with the team
Still sittin at the end of the draft ass nigga
Getting high on these low lifes, dead the chumps, give em no life
Cut em loose, keep your knife
Don't meet a ho and make her your wife
Don't make a ho your husband either
Hard to win the game when you're playing with a cheater
I be telling them that you can't change niggas
Better off keeping that change for the meter

And these niggas be acting up, Rhi-Rhi must be serious
Wonder what that shit hittin' foe, real niggas is curious!
These niggas stuck on my whole joint
Already know how the high feel
Let the chick know she is not low, even though she in high heels
Six hundred for the gas, that ain't nothing but a high bill

19,We Are the World,USA for Africa,USA for,We Are the World USA for,"There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all

We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need

[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me

Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand

[Chorus]

When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Let us realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as one

Thank you"

Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue

Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy

Going to get an old feeling, when you walk through that door

Starting all over again
The moon comes up
And the music calls
You're getting tired of
Staring at the same four walls
You're out of your room
And down on the street
Moving through the crowd
In the midnight heat
The traffic roars
The sirens scream
You look at the faces
It's just like a dream
Nobody knows where you're going
Nobody cares where you've been

You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness
Beneath the neon light

Concrete under your feet
It's in your moves
It's in your blood
You're a man of the street

When you said goodbye
You were on the run
Trying to get away
From the things you've done
Now you're back again
And you're feeling strange
So much has happened
But nothing has changed
You still don't know
Where you're going
You're still just a face in the crowd

Cause you belong to the city
You belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness

A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die, but can we...

In august moon's surrender to
A dust cloud on the rise
Wild boys fallen far from glory
Reckless and so hungered
On the razors edge you trail
Because there's murder by the roadside
In a sore afraid new world

They tried to break us
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes
Wild boys always shine

You got sirens for a welcome
There's bloodstain for your pain
And your telephone been ringing while
You're dancing in the rain
Wild boys wonder where is glory
Where is all you angels
Now the figureheads have fell
And lovers war with arrows over
Secrets they could tell

They tried to tame you
Looks like they'll try again

Wild boys never lose it
Wild boys never chose this way
Wild boys never close your eyes

When I don't know what to say
Maybe I just wouldn't know
What to do with my strength anyway
Have we become a habit?
Do we distort the facts?

Now, there's no turning back

Close your eyes and try to dream
Clear your mind and do your best
To try and wash the palette clean
We can't begin to know it
How much we really care
I hear your voice inside me
I see your face everywhere
Still you say

Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you

Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done

She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
She wore a...

Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

Until that first hello, until that first smile

I wouldn't change a thing
Cause this love is everlasting

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Ooh yeah

Girl you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough
To say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before
Now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, and suddenly you're in love

Each day I pray, this love affair would last forever
Oh hoh
Suddenly, Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up, suddenly you're in love

Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
I'm driving by your house
Though I know you're not home

[Chorus 1]
But I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Verse 2]
I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream?
Now I don't understand what happened to our love
But babe I'm gonna get you back
I'm going to show you what I'm made of

[Chorus 2]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
I see you walking real slow
Smiling at everyone
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Verse 3]
Out on the road today
I saw a Deadhead sticker on a Cadillac
A little voice inside my head said
""Don't look back, you can never look back""
I thought I knew what love was, what did I know?
Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but...

[Chorus 3]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got the top pulled down
Radio on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

[Chorus 4]
I can see you
Your brown skin shining in the sun
You got your hair slicked back and those
Wayfarers on, baby
I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

And the city don't know
What the city is getting
The creme de la creme of
The chess world in a show
With everything
But Yul Brynner
Times flies -
Doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean Spa
Had the chess boys in it
All change - don't you know that when you play at this level
There's no ordinary venue
It's Iceland or the Philippines or Hastings or;
Or this place!
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky then the God's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One town's very like another when your head's down
Over your pieces
Brother
It's a drag
It's a bore
It's really such a pity
To be looking at the board not looking at the city
Whaddya mean? You've seen one crowded
Polluted
Stinking town

Girls
Warm and sweet
Warm
Sweet
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every moves's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline

One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me
Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
Or reclining Buddah
And thank God I'm only watching the game
Controlling it
I don't see you guys rating the kind of mate
I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you'd better go back to your bars
Your temples
Your massage parlors
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a God in every golden cloister
A little flesh
A little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble"

Had a band and we tried real hard
Jimmy quit and Jody got married
I shoulda known we'd never get far
But when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Ya, I'd always wanna be there

Ain't no use in complainin'
When you got a job to do
Spent my evenin's down at the drive-in
And that's when I met you, ya

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me that you'd wait forever
Oh, and when you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never
Those were the best days of my life
Back in the summer of '69

Oh!

Man, we were killin' time
We were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever
Forever, no...

Yeah!

And now the times are changin'
Look at everything that's come and gone
Sometimes when I play that old six string
I think about ya 'n wonder what went wrong

Standin' on your mama's porch
You told me it would last forever
Oh, the way you held my hand
I knew that it was now or never

I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well
On the way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you
You might need it someday

I can't tell you what you're feeling inside
I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing and you got to
Look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you

Why did someone else have to pull you through?
Did they steal you away like a thief in the night?

Why don't they play what they played
On the nights you danced with me?
Remember the one we made love to endlessly

Under the ruins of a walled city
Crumbling towers and beams of yellow light
No flags of truce, no cries of pity
The siege guns had been pounding all through the night
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the fields I'd known
I recognized the walls where I'd once laid
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]
And if I built this fortress around your heart
Encircled you in trenches and barbed wire
Then let me build a bridge
For I cannot fill the chasm
And let me set the battlements on fire

[Verse 2]
Then I went off to fight some battle
That I'd invented inside my head
Away so long for years and years
You probably thought or even wished that I was dead
While the armies are all sleeping
Beneath the tattered flag we'd made
I had to stop in my track for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This prison has now become your home
A sentence you seem prepared to pay
It took a day to build the city
We walked through its streets in the afternoon
As I returned across the lands I'd known
I recognized the fields where I'd once played
I had to stop in my tracks for fear
Of walking on the mines I'd laid

Take a chance, come on and dance
Guys grab a girl, don't wait, make her twirl

Tryin' to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so yo what's up
Hands in the air, come on say yeah

The crowd is live and I pursue this groove
Party people in the house
Move, move

Pause, take a breath and go for yours
On my command now hit the dance floor
It's gonna make you sweat 'til you bleed
Is that dope enough, indeed
I paid the price, I control the dice
I'm more precise, to the point I'm nice
The music takes control, your heart and soul
Unfold, your body is free and a whole
Dance till you can't, dance
Till you can't dance no more
Get on the floor and get raw
Then come back and upside down
Easy now, let me see ya

Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love

Still we manage to stay together

There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow

They said, it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you, I can't do without

Has quite the same, ooh ooh

Once again we sit in silence

Only emptiness inside us

We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul

I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

[Verse 2]
Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul

'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, no, no

Something just went wrong

Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul

So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
But baby it ain't over until it's over

Did we give up
But we always worked things out
And all my doubts and fears
Kept me wondering, yeah
If I'd always, always be in love

So many years we've tried
To keep our love alive
Cause baby it ain't over until it's over
So many tears we've cried
So much pain inside

136,Where Does My Heart Beat Now,Celine Dion,Celine Dion,Where Does My Heart Beat Now Celine Dion,"[Verse 1]
So much to believe in, we were lost in time
Everything I needed
I feel in your eyes
Always thought of keeping
Your heart next to mine
But now that seems so far away
Don't know how love could leave
Without a trace
Where do silent hearts go

[Chorus]
Where does my heart beat now
Where is the sound
That only echoes through the night
Where does my heart beat now
I can't live without
Without feeling it inside
Where do all the lonely hearts go

[Verse 2]
Candle in the water, drifting helplessly
Hiding from the thunder
Come and rescue me
Driven by hunger
Of the endless dream
I'm searching for the hand that I can hold
I'm reaching for the arms that let me know
Where do silent hearts go

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Then one touch overcomes the silence
Love still survives
Two hearts needing one another
Give me wings to fly

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I've got someone to give my heart to
Feel it getting stronger and stronger
And stronger
And I feel inside

[Outro]
Hearts are made to last
Until the end of time"

Drums Please!

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your jeep or your benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 3]
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

[Hook] repeated till it fade out
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind"

I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change

The world is closing in
And did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers?

The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

[Verse 3]
Walking down the street
And distant memories
Are buried in the past forever

I follow the Moskva
And down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change

[Chorus]
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change

The wind of change blows straight
Into the face of time
Like a storm wind that will ring
The freedom bell for peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to sing

Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away

The rain is pouring down
The shade is on the window
And loneliness is all around

A little voice I'm hearing says
Don't you stay inside
But I can't fight this feeling got L.U.S.T. on my mind
I head for the arena where lovers try their fate

Moving through the darkness
I take my place and wait
A pretty bird beside me says hello with her eyes
She looks so sweet and lovely
But is she N.A.S.T.Y?

P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N

Her lips are calling to me
No way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling
Intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle
We set our bodies free
And while the music played on
She loved me down from A to Z

The night is getting longer
I start to realize
Don't know what I've got into the girl is C.R.A.Z.Y
I try to cool the fire like I oughta should
But there's no way to turn back
The S.E.X. is just too good

P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N

Don't be tempted to touch the fire
I should've read all the warning signs
You might get burned by your own desire
I lost my mind
I must have been blind
I never knew another lover that was evil under cover

Then I discovered you, girl
You're like no other
Doing the time for the crime
I was blind
To the games that you were playing
Words that you were saying

Going out of my mind
You're like a hurricane
Drive me insane you're like a heart attack
Know it's a fact
You got the knack to drop a man to his knees

P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win

Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss

[Verse 2]
Arrows through hearts
Drawn on a misty window
You're taking me home in the rain
My heart it's beating don't say no
My head keeps saying, ""Take it slow""

[Chorus]
I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss

You're giving me a feeling
It's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment
Spontaneous
Ooh this is not like me
To follow my heart so easily

[Bridge]
I am reckless, impulsive
I never imagined you could blow my theory apart
But now you're running away with my heart, my heart

[Chorus]
I don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna think clear
Don't analyze
What I'm doing here
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss

You're giving me a feeling
It's a sudden rush
Acting on the moment
Spontaneous
Wanna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself
In your kiss

[Outro]
Impulsive, I wanna be, impulsive
I'm gonna be impulsive
Reckless
And lose myself, lose myself"
148,Love Is a Wonderful Thing,Michael Bolton,Michael Bolton,Love Is a Wonderful Thing Michael Bolton,"Birds fly, they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines, it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means

The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture
Just a matter of fact

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing

The only thing a river knows
Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally

The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing

Oh when the cold wind blows
I know you're gonna be there to warm me
That's what keeps me goin'
And our sweet love will keep on growin'

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing

Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
It's what makes honey taste sweet
It's what makes your life complete"
149,Rhythm of My Heart,Rod Stewart,Rod Stewart,Rhythm of My Heart Rod Stewart,"Across the street the river runs
Down in the gutter life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running under cover
Of a helicopter blade

Flames are getting higher
In effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still alive
Somewhere, some way
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness
Light it up!
Light it up!
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Oh, yeah

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle
Of a slot machine
Love may still exist
In another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue

Drinkin' cocoa on the bear skin rug
The door bell rang, who could it be?
Thought to myself then started to shrug

Got to the door, ding dong, who is it?
My girl's best friend had payed me a visit
Sly as can be tight dress and all
She knew that I was faithful, I really didn't have the gall

I tried to chill, she made the move
Now, I know my girlfriend wouldn't approve
I didn't realize my girl was settin' me up
Yo, my girlfriend didn't trust me, no

Yeah, but she lost control, I wouldn't take the bait
I said, ""Chill baby, baby chill baby, baby wait""

Just an example of how another brother can trample
Ruin your life, sleep with your wife
Watch your behind

There was a friend of mine named Jay
Would come over late at night and say, ""Hey""
I watched the fight, I thought is was alright
'Cause me and Jay who were really really tight

So damned close we had the same blood type
Months went by and my wife got big
We were havin' a child and I got another gig
So I let Jay move into the crib and chill

He had his own room and helped pay the bills
The time had come for the baby down to the scene
It looked like Jay and I couldn't believe
Before my eyes in the delivery room

Eleventh grade and Joe, I knew it all
I fall in love for the very first time
With this girl she really blew my mind

Inner sense and whole lotta class
Style that could give you whiplash

She was the world and I was on top

Time went by, she filled my universe
We made love, she said, ""I was the first""

I think your girl's been playin' tic tac toe

Go away for business, come back with a tan
Comes home late at night from work
You cooked him dinner now you feel like a jerk

Sayin' he didn't have time to eat
And he's not even hungry, he wants to retreat
To the bedroom he said his head hurts
You're only makin' love in radical spurts

Mysterious calls and the phone goes click
You say to yourself, ""I'm gonna hit him with a brick""
Ain't no way he could be cheatin' on me
I wonder who bought him those B.V.D.'s

Dressed to a T to hang with the fellas
Over the guys and I'm gettin' jealous

At somebody coming in

And while she's straightening her stockings
Her hair has gotten wet

At the playground, ya know
That's where I saw this cutie
This girl was swingin' and she looked so fly
On the monkey bars, we climbed up to the top and
She touched my hand that's when I fell in love

Stand just a little too close

Maybe they're seein' something we don't, darling

You'd act so nervous, could you be falling for me?
It took the rumor to make me wonder
Now I'm convinced I'm going under
Thinkin' 'bout you every day
Dream 'bout you every night
I'm hoping that you feel the same way
Now that we know it, let's really show it, darling

What was never meant to be

I know the emptiness
You feel inside
You're thinking if you break away
You'll never survive

Beats just for you
Come on and take my hand
And I'll pull you through

Until you want them to

So you say that you can't go on
Love left you cryin'
And you say, all your hope is gone
And what's the use in tryin'

What you need is to have some faith
Shake off those sad blues
Get yourself a new view

Oh, nothing is as sad as it seems, you know
'Cause, some day you'll laugh at the heartache
Some day, you'll laugh at the pain
Somehow you'll get through the heartbreak
Somehow you can get through the rain

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness

You think your world is over
Baby, just remember this
Nothing heals a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness
Time, love and tenderness

I understand how you're feeling now
And what you've been through
But your world's gonna turn around
So baby, don't you be blue

All it takes is a little time
To make it better
The hurt won't last forever

Oh, all your tears are all gonna dry, you know
'Cause some day you'll laugh at the heartache
Some day you'll laugh at the pain
You may be down on your luck
But baby, that old luck's gonna change

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart
Like time, love and tenderness

You think your world is over

When love puts you through the fire
When love puts you to the test
Nothing cures a broken heart

You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving, your loving

[Verse 1]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Let's hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

[Verse 2]
Silky, milky her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
'Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
You're sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me (to the bridge)
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

[Verse 3]
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Witcha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
'Cause brother's been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the homeboys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby, hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way

[Chorus]
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
I need an around the way, girl
Around the way, girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way, girl
I'm asking you

You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving
You got me shook up, shook down

You got me shook up, shook down
You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving

Just think of me,
And I'll be there

On the edge of a waking dream
Over Rivers

To set your mind and your body free

I like the way you wiggle
You don't jingle, but you jiggle
So spread open your love

Move it like a mover
She wanted to groove
So I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn
So we played school and I schooled her

But not like this
We can toss and turn
Rumble, tumble and twist
Anything you want, I'll give it
Fantasies we'll live it
So lay down and relax
Lover, my lady
Lady lover, my baby girl
Spread your wings
So we can fly around the world

Your fingertips are calming me
When you dropped the kisses
Suzie Q, you dropped the bomb on me
Stretch it, stretch it
Flex it, flex it
Gimme the permission

Bless it like buddha

In the hopes that there's a Heaven
And everyday I'm more confused
As the saints turn into sinners
All the heroes and legends
I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay
And I feel this empty place inside
So afraid that I've lost my faith
Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Please show me the way
And as I slowly drift to sleep
For a moment dreams are sacred
I close my eyes and know there's peace
In a world so filled with hatred
That I wake up each morning and turn on the news
To find we've so far to go
And I keep on hoping for a sign
So afraid I just won't know
Show me the way, show me the way
Bring me tonight to the mountain
And take my confusion away
And show me the way
And if I see a light, should I believe
Tell me how will I know
Show me the way, show me the way
Take me tonight to the river
And wash my illusions away
Show me the way, show me the way
Give me the strength and the courage
To believe that I'll get there someday
And please show me the way
Every night I say a prayer
In the hopes that there's a Heaven"

From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete

Tell me how to stop the rain

You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me

Convinced me she's fine
But when she leaves
I'm not so sure

It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame

Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as she seems

Why don't I see her cry for help?
Why don't I feel her cry for help?
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all

The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste

Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help

No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help
I will be there when you cry for help
Why don't I hear her cry for help?

All that I need is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me cry for help
All I can do is cry for help

All that I need is to cry for help
I will be there when you cry for help

No need to feel ashamed

Chances drift by
They'll never discover these feelings I hide

Will be mine
They cross my mind

But I am standing still
A life of pages
Waiting to be filled

A heart that's hopeful
A head that's full of dreams
But this becoming
Is harder than it seems

Feels like I'm
Looking for a reason
Roamin' through the night to find
My place in this world
My place in this world
Not a lot to lean on
I need your light to help me find
My place in this world
My place in this world

If there are millions
Down on their knees
Among the many
Can you still hear me

Hear me asking
Where do I belong?
Is there a vision
That I can call my own?

Show me, I'm

Well I see him on the TV
Preachin' 'bout the promised lands
He tells me to believe in Jesus
And steals the money from my hands
Some say he was a good man
But Lord I think he sinned, yeah
Twenty-two years of mental tears
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore
To find his country didn't want him back
Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon
Our lawyers took his wife and kids, no regrets
In a time I don't remember
In a war he can't forget
He cried ""Forgive me for what I've done there
Cause I never meant the things I did""

[Chorus]
And give me something to believe in
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in
Oh, Lord arise

[Verse 2]
My best friend died a lonely man
In some Palm Springs hotel room
I got the call last Christmas Eve
And they told me the news
I tried all night not to break down and cry
As the tears rolled down my face
I felt so cold and empty
Like a lost soul out of place
And the mirror, mirror on the wall
Sees my smile it fades again

[Chorus]
And give me something to believe in (and give me something to believe in)
If there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in (and give me something to believe in)
Oh, Lord arise

Sometimes I wish to God I didn't know now
The things I didn't know then
Road, you gotta take me home

[Verse 3]
I drive by the homeless sleeping on
A cold dark street
Like bodies in an open grave
Underneath the broken old neon sign
That used to read
Jesus Saves
A mile away live the rich folks
And I see how they're living it up
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup
And it just makes me wonder
Why so many lose, so few win

[Chorus]
And give me something to believe in
And give me something to believe in, if there's a Lord above
And give me something to believe in, oh Lord arise

For all we know
It's been there all the time

Sitting idle in our boat

181,Silent Lucidity,Queensryche,Queensryche,Silent Lucidity Queensryche,"Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension

(I)... will be watching over you
(I)... am gonna help you see it through
(I)... will protect you in the night
(I)... am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity

-spoken during solo-
[Visualize your dream]
[Record it in the present tense]
[Put it into a permanent form]
[If you persist in your efforts]
[You can achieve dream control]
[Dream control]
[How's that then, better?]
[Hug me]

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...

(I)... will be watching over you
(I)... am gonna help you see it through
(I)... will protect you in the night

I'm not in love, oh no, just because

I like to see you, but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us

How can you help it, when the music starts to play
And your ability to reason, is swept away
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you

Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby

Yo no se quien ha mentido

I don't drink or smoke ain't into dope
Won't try no coke, ask me how I do it, I cope
My only addiction has to do with the female species
I eat 'em raw like sushi

No me gustan ternos, mi estilo es moderno
Si me enterno, you me enfermo
Mi apariencia es dura, vivo en la locura
No me vengan con ternuras

So please don't judge a book by its cover
There's more to being a latin lover
You got to know how to deal with a woman
That won't let go
The price you pay for being a gigolo

There's not a woman that can handle
A man like me
That's why I juggle two or three
I ain't one to commit, you can omit that bit
You pop the question that's it
Haber uno, dos, tres, cuatro mujeres
Y la situaci?all?no muere
No es un delito calmo mi apetito
Con un llanto o un grito

So again don't let my lyrics mislead you
I don't love you but I need you
Would you rather have me lie
Take a piece of your pie and say bye
Or be honest and rub your thighs

Well, it's ten o'clock and I'm two hours late
I never said I was a prompt date
But you kept persisting that I meet your parents
Huh, they're going to love my appearance

Ding dong el timbre suena
Tu madre abre, que vieja mas buena
Le digo ¡Hola! Pero no para bola
Que se ha creido vieja chola

Go and serve the food mom
Que tengo ambre
If you don't hurry, me va a dar un calambre
Y usted señor? Why's your chin on the floor?
Sierra la boca por favor

What's this amor, these little huevos?
Esto s?que yo no pruebo

I'm used to good ol' fashioned

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

Say your mine
And give yourself to the
Feelings that you know
I'm needing
All that you can give me
All the things
That you do so well
Words are healing
Sweet anticipation
Making spells
As the shadows close in
Fall across all our yesterdays

Look into myself and reason
But I could never never see or
Make sense of the dealings

Turn around
Am I looking at salvation
Make me realise all that I am
You put the light inside this man

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear
All the problems, all the fears
And the world seems to disappear

You're so fine
Lose my mind
And the world seems to disappear

With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come

Hot, got a deal, you wanna know?
The live of truely delightful
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze
Music makes motion, moves like a maze
All inside of me, heart especially
Note of the rhythm, where I wanna be
Flowin', glowin', electric eyes
You dip to the dive, baby yo, realize
When will you see the funky side of me?
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key
Get, get, wit' it, wit' it
Can't think, quit it, quit it
Stomp on the streets when I hear a funk beat
Playin' pop like follow hoods true

191,All This Time,Sting,Sting,All This Time Sting,"[Verse 1]
I looked out across the river today
Saw a city in the fog and an old church town where the seagulls play
Saw the sad shire horses walking home in the sodium light
Two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night

[Chorus]
All this time the river flowed
Endlessly to the sea

[Verse 2]
Two priests came 'round our house tonight
One young, one old, to offer prayers for the dying to serve the final rite
One to learn, one to teach which way the cold wind blows
And fussing and flapping in priestly black like a murder of crows

[Chorus]

If I had my way, take a boat from the river and I'd bury the old man
I'd bury him at sea

[Verse 3]
Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the earth
Better to be poor than be a fat man in the eye of the needle
As these words were spoken I swear I hear the old man laughing
What good is a used up world and how could it be worth having?

All this time the river flowed
Endlessly like a silent tear
All this time the river flowed
Father, if Jesus exists then how come he never lives here?

[Bridge]
Teachers told the Romans built this place
They built a wall and a temple and an edge of the empire garrison town
They lived and they died
They prayed to their gods, but the stone gods did not make a sound
And their empire crumbles 'till all that was left
Were the stones the workmen found

[Outro]
All this time the river flowed
In the falling light of a Northern sun
If I had my way, take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in the congregations, they only get better one by one
One by one"

Call me, call me by my name or call me by number
You put me through it
I'll still be doing it the way I do it
And yet, you try to make me forget
Who I really am, don't tell me I know best
I'm not the same as all the rest

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I've been a player in the crowd scene
A flicker on the big screen
My soul embraces one more in a million faces
High hopes and aspirations, and years above my station
Maybe but all this time I've tried to walk with dignity and pride

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I can't wear this uniform without some compromises
Because you'll find out that we come
In different shapes and sizes
No one can be myself like I can
For this job I'm the best man
And while this may be true
You are the one and only you

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me

I am the one and only
Nobody I'd rather be
I am the one and only
You can't take that away from me"
193,O.P.P.,Naughty by Nature,Naughty by,O.P.P. Naughty by,"[Intro: Treach]
Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em!

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it? I'll take it, frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin', shoutin', sayin' it
O is for ""other,"" P is for ""peoples',"" scratch your temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occasion if the other party isn't gamin'
It seems I gotta start the explainin', bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number
And then left feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day
She's what you wanna know about, then you call up
And it’s her girlfriend’s or her cousin’s house?!
It’s not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T;
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Oh, that’s why she’s scary)
It's O.P.P., time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship, there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who think it's wrong 'cause I was splittin' and co-hittin' that
Well, if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

[Hook]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last homie!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the homies!)

[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies O.P.P. means somethin' gifted
The first two letters' the same
But the last is somethin' different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five-letter word
Rhymin' with ""cleanness"" or ""meanness""
I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sorta properly
I'll say the last P, hmmm, stands for ""property""
Now lady, here comes a kiss
Blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother
Who had another, like, a girl or wife
And you just had to stop a toast
'Cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you
And you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway!
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
'Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave
And only y'all would know; and then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
Now don't be shy
'Cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.!) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Hook]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies!)

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me, I had a girl and she knew that
Matter of fact, her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall-out, disagreement, yeah, an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment
Bust it! That wasn't the thing
It must've been the way she hit the ceiling, 'cause after that she kept on comin' back and catchin' feelings
I said: ""Let's go, my girl is comin', so you gotta leave.""
She said: ""Oh no, I love you, Treach!""
I said: ""Now child, please! You gots to leave
Come grab your coat, right now you gotta go!""
I said: ""Now look you chooses stairs or choose the stair window
This was a fling, a little thing
You shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cause you know I was OPP, hell, from the very start!""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round
Runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep yo' mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him!
Excitin', isn't it? A special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messin' with
Him or her, for sure ain't goin' to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy, I'm with it

[Hook]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)"
194,Freedom 90,George Michael,George Michael,Freedom 90 George Michael,"[Chorus]
I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
Because I would really, really love to stick around

[Verse 1]
Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick, just a buddy and me
We had every big-shot goodtime band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don’t think that I’ll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

[Bridge]
Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last
That's what you get
I say that's what you get
That's what you get for changing your mind
And after all this time
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me
Freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
I will not give you up, freedom
Gotta have some faith in the sound
You got to give what you take
It's the one good thing that I've got, freedom
I won't let you down, freedom
So please don't give me up, freedom
Cause I would really, really love to stick around

[Outro]
I'll hold on to my freedom
May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live"
195,I Saw Red,Warrant,Warrant,I Saw Red Warrant,"Ooh it must be magic
How inside your eyes I see my destiny
Every time we kiss
I feel you breathe your love so deep inside of me
If the moon and stars should fall
They'd be easy to replace
I would lift you up to heaven
And you would take their place

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

Everyday I wake up
I thank God that you are still a part of me
We've opened up the door to which
So many people never find the key
And if the sun should ever fail to send its light
We would burn a thousand candles
And make everything alright

Then I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore

I've been hurt and I've been blind
I'm not sure that I'll be fine
I never thought it would end this way

'Cause I saw red
When I opened up the door
I saw red
My heart just spilled onto the floor
And I didn't need to see his face
I saw yours
I saw red and then I closed the door
I don't think I'm gonna love you anymore
Ooh it must be magic"
196,Miles Away,Winger,Winger,Miles Away Winger,"So this is love, or so you tell me
As you're walkin', out the door
Months go by, and I know for certain
It's not the love, I'm lookin' for

Some times, just for a moment
I reach out; hope you're still there

Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most...
You were miles away...

It's hard to tell, what you're goin' through
You kept your feelings locked inside of you
Open your heart, and chances are
What you're feelin', I'm feelin' too

If only, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most
You were miles away

When times were tough, and you were down and out
Who was there by your side?
Now you've gone; I'm so tired of bein' alone..
With only your promises...

Lonliness just fades away
Thoughts of you; just memories
No cryin' now, for what we're missin'
Time won't forget what you meant to me

Hold me, just for a moment
Hold on, to the dreams that we had

Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore
Miles away
Nothin' left of what we had
Just when I needed you most, whoa-oh
Miles away
No; you're never turnin' back
I just can't wait anymore

Album: Blacks' Magic
Song: Do You Want Me

You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

CHORUS
Do you really want me, baby? Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like

Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up

CHORUS

Who me? A tease? Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song

That's all and showing just a little bit of faith

There's a soul in the city
Watching over us I swear
There's a soul in the city
There's a whole world waiting out there, ah yeah

I got plans for us playing like a skip on a record
Through my head all night long
But when we walk that darkened stairway and step out on the roof
I know what we're feeling can't be wrong, ah yeah

This air of silence
In the bedroom and all around
Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away

But it's over now
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow
It must have been love
But it's over now
From the moment we touched
Till the time had run out

Make believing we're together
That I'm sheltered by your heart
But in and outside
I turn to water
Like a teardrop in your palm
And it's a hard
Winter's day
I dream away

Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing... I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All died when you went away

It's everywhere that you go (look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (life that you know)

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

[Verse 2]
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

[Bridge]
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be"

""Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep
Is there somewhere you can tell me?""

He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there

You and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you

They said you were leavin', someone's swept your heart away
From the look upon your face I see it's true

So tell me all about it, tell me 'bout the plans you're makin'
Oh, then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
And how am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin' for is gone

I'm too proud for cryin', didn't come here to break down
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you when I built my world around
The hope that one day we'd be so much more than friends?

I don't wanna know the price I'm gonna pay for dreaming, oh
Even now it's more than I can take

Tell me how am I supposed to live without you
Now that I've been loving you so long
How am I supposed to live without you

When all that I've been livin' for is gone

When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can""

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you

She holds me back
But she goes too far
Winding me up just to let me down

With the formal rising
I was scared
I think I was possesed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know
How it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real!

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She had an attitude
I can't explain
You never know if your in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt

Her blood was hot
She burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

Would we've been all right?

[Pre-Chorus]
Release me
Can you release me?

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy
Come on, darlin', hear me, darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me
Release me, release me

[Verse 3]
I'm not going back to you anymore
Finally my weakened heart is healing
Though very slow
So stop coming around my door
'Cause you're not gonna find what you're looking for

[Chorus]
Ohh, come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
Somehow it's just not that easy
Oh, oh, oh, baby
Come on darlin', now, hear me darlin'
'Cause you're a waste of time for me
I'm trying to make you see
That baby, you've just got to release me

Now tell me
What is this power you've got on me?
What is this power? Ohh

Come on, baby, come on, baby
You knew it was time to just let go
'Cause we wanna be free
But somehow it's just not that easy

Better make tracks
Fast on the double
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Verse 1: Glenn Medeiros]
You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind

But she just got an attitude
Leads you on
Then leaves you blue
Can't you see
She's really just a waste of time

One day
She'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think
Your love will win her in the end
Think again

[Chorus:]
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief
That she's been putting you through
Ooh

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me
I know
I know better than
Better than, better than
Bet, bet better than you

[Verse 2: Glenn Medeiros]
She gets you hot
Then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
Cause she knows
You'll always give her one more try

You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playing to the crowd
But tell me
Do you really like standing in line?

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Glenn Medeiros:]
I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
(That would be a lie)

Cause there's no one
In this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied I know
Cause I tried

[Rap: Bobby Brown]
Jump in
One thing I hate
Is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
Cause I've tried to make you mine

For the last time
So take this here as a dis
And a goodbye

She ain't worth it
Even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip
And get a grip quick

Fast in a hurry
Cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

But then it fades away

Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain

Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

If wishes came true
Then all the dreams at night of love were real
I'd be holding you
If wishes came true
Then I would be that someone
Always special in your heart
And we would still be lovers
Not apart
If wishes came true

Now you're gone
And I'm on my own
Feeling lost inside since you said goodbye
In my dreams
I still feel your touch
Lying next to me
Feeling ecstasy

Take me back
Turn back the hands of time
When you kissed me in the warm September rain

Back before my heart was filled with pain
If only we could be in love that way again

I need you badly
Give our love one more chance

So peace, stay off my back
Or I will attack, and you don't want that

You say it's 'cause you're dreaming
Of how good it's going to be
You say you've been around
And now you've finally found
Everything you wanted and needed in me

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

Inside I'm dying
To see you crying
How can I make you understand
I care about you
So much about you, baby
I'm trying to say this as gently as I can

'Cause I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do
But I don't have the heart to love you
Not the way you want me to

You're so trusting and open
Hoping that love will start
But I don't have the heart, oh no
I don't have the heart

I don't have the heart to hurt you
It's the last thing I want to do

Has punched a hole in the night time mist
I climb through the window and down to the street
I'm shining like a new dime
The downtown trains are full
Full of all them Brooklyn girls
They try so hard to break out of their little worlds

You wave your hand and they scatter like crows
They have nothing that'll ever capture your heart
They're just thorns without the rose
Be careful of them in the dark
Oh if I was the one you chose to be your only one
Oh baby can't you hear me now, can't you hear me now

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same
On a downtown train

I know your window and I know its late
I know your stairs and your doorway
I walk down your street and past your gate
I stand by the light of the four way
And watch them as they fall, oh baby
They all having their heart attacks
They stay at the carnival
But they'll never win you back

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same
You leave me lonely
Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
Every night, every night its just the same

Will I see you tonight on a downtown train
All my dreams, all my dreams fall like rain
On a downtown train

Now be it thick as a milkshake
Or thin as a cornflake
I love you to death but I ain't
Pressed with a heartbreak
And anyway who cares about what
Other people talk about
I rather hear it from the horse's mouth
See I believe in, being believed in
No love life for low ties is all paper thin
But watch for the trickery
Some people are slippery
They appear making history
Disappear like a mystery
It ain't your fault
But you're a walking bank vault
The people of life make life bitter as salt
They say what they want to say
Play how they want to play
But you got to live your life day by day
In order to survive you overlook and overcome
Selfish attitude or lack of
Gratitude from the dumb
It ain't easy being you and
Everything you want to be
But whatever you do is alright with me
The bon-diddlely-dee
The overweight lover MC, the cap
The rapper hand clap, foot tap

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
""Did you stop?"" No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

[Verse 3]
Take heed cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this. Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say ""Damn!""
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

250,Praying for Time,George Michael,George Michael,Praying for Time George Michael,"These are the days of the open hand, they will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man, whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor, and most of us are not sure
If we have too much, but we'll take our chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
I guess somewhere along the way he must have let us all out to play
Turned his back, and all god's children crept out the back door

And it's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

These are the days of the empty hand, oh you hold on to what you can
And charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man, your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say ""What's mine is mine and not yours""
I may have too much but i'll take my chances
'Cause god's stopped keeping score
And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That he can't come back
'Cause he has no children to come back for

It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time"

How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

Look at us now, look at us baby
Still trying to work it out, never get it right
We must be fools, we must be crazy

Ohhh... it's a no win situation

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends, tell me
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

We lie awake, this wall between us
We're just not talking, we've got so much to say
Let's break these chains, our love can free us
Ohhh... ain't it time we started trying
Ohhh... gotta stop this love from dying

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

Baby love is tough but we can take it
How can we be lovers
Baby times are rough but we can make it
We can work it out

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends, tell me
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

252,Do You Remember,Phil Collins,Phil Collins,Do You Remember Phil Collins,"[Verse 1]
We never talked about it
But I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time

'cos I love you, but I can't take any more
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
Yes we could try, like we tried before
When you kept on telling me those lies

[Chorus]
Do you remember[x4]

[Verse 2]
There seemed no way to make up
'cos it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget
You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us
But it seemed too far for you to go

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Through all of my life
In spite of all the pain
You know people are funny sometimes
'cos they just can't wait
To get hurt again

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
There are things we won't recall
Feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it
Cos we never seemed to have the time
There was always something more important to do
More important to say
But ""I love you"" wasn't one of those things
And now it's too late

Do you remember
Now its over

So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee

You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom

Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""

Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same

Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

Lately, I've been trying to figure out your mind
And why you keep dissing me
Poor little me
And why you have a change of heart
Then turn it all around
And then try to put it on me
Poor little me

But don't you know
I can be a trip
I can make things hard

That's why I try to stop myself before I start
'Cause I can make it tough
I can make it rough
But I won't

And claim that you're missing me
Poor little me
When you knew all the time
That you could've been with your homegirl
Loving and a kissing on me
Sweet little me

But don't you know
If you wanna be a man
You gotta work real hard
If you wanna make me feel like I'm your number one
And nothing in the world should make us part
'Cause we can make it work
If you take away the hurt from the heart

But I choose not to
(Oh, oh) Deep inside of you
I think there's still good in you, boy

Don't give me no lip
And I'll be sweet to you

I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit
I wanna give it, I'm giving you the benefit (woo)

Forgive me when I get it wrong
Sometimes it's hard to be that strong

I'd find a way somehow

I was more than a desperate man

Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said ""dance"" not ""fuck"", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunt on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said ""I was just tryna chill and make bangers"" (bangers)
Tell all these old bitches they in danger (stop)
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape (brrrt)

And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun (brrrt, woo)
And we all know you ain't that type (no)
I smack you and the bitch that you act like (yeah)

Nails done, hair lit, keep them both laced (laced)

Sometimes I don't know how much more I've got

Maybe I've set myself up for the kill
Tell me how much do you think you can take
Until the heart in you is starting to break?
Sometimes it feels like it will

Too high or too low there ain't no in-betweens

Out of the darkness, into the light
Leaving the scene of the crime
Either I'm wrong or I'm perfectly right every time
Sometimes I lie awake, night after night
Coming apart at the seams
Eager to please, ready to fight
Why do I go to extremes?

I drove to the party and I stepped on in, just to see what I could see
Everybody knew what I was lookin' for. I was lookin' for some company, that's right!

But a year to make love she wanted you to wait

I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, ""How do you like the show?"" She said, ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man,"" she tried to pretend
She said, ""No I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewing'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say, ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend"

But now the tensions killing me
No place left for words to hide
I never thought it could be quite so tough
Lips once sealed are splitting up
There ain't no secrets to outshine father time

Whispers in the dark don't do

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I don't have any ifs
I am positive
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
We're never gonna be alone
Our love is stone

Too many words are too much a crowd
I wanna spill 'em or they'll leak out
I'm so glad to get the chance
I kept it secret till I knew for sure
So not to pick my heart off the floor
Now it's time to take a stand
Heart in hand

Whispers in the dark don't do
Let's hit the lights
Now I just got to spread the news

So what are you telling me?
What are you telling me?
What are you telling me?

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
When I drop a tear
You are always here
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I'm look at a living dream
Don't wake me up

Don't stop
Love me till you drop
It's alright with me
One sharp arrow through the heart
It's alright, it's alright
Now whistle

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I will never give you up
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
You're my one and only love

Whispers in the dark don't do
Let's hit the lights

So what are you telling me now?
What are you telling me?
What are you telling me?
What are you telling me?
What are you telling me now, girl?

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
I wanna tell everybody you're my cup of tea
I wanna tell the whole wide world about you
Your love never shakes
You don't alternate

I wanna tell the whole wide world about you

My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same
Without you, I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl you'd never, never know
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

Without you, my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
Knowing someday I'd grow strong
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only you as we grow old

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you"

299,Tic-Tac-Toe,Kyper,Kyper,Tic-Tac-Toe Kyper,"[Verse 1]
Tic Tac Toe is a game I used to play
When I was little I used to say
I got the X and I got the O
It don't matter cause it's Tic-Tac--Toe

Now I'm a little bit older
I like to play just a little bit bolder
I like gettin' girls and givin' em pearls
And their legs across my shoulders

I love to go to the disco
See a fly girl and say hello
They just look me in the eye and pass right by
With that booty shakin' like Jello

I like to speak cause that's bein' nice
It makes me mad when I have to speak twice
But that's the game that girls like to play
It's just Tic-Tac-Toe and roll the other way

[Chorus]
X, and O. As in yes, and no
X, and O. As in sex, maybe so

X is for yes and O is for no
X is for sex or maybe so
You might get some if you play this game
All girls love it but smooth is their game

[Verse 2]
That's why they just walk right by
Laughin', gigglin', shakin' that pie
Girls are what you what when you come up to them
So don't play dumb and try to school em

That's when you got to be real cool
Jump in the biz and act a fool
Pull out the portable car phone
Next thing you know you'll be drivin' em home

On the way there you're thinkin' bout one thing
Girls ain't dumb they know you want the wild thing
You through the X and go for the kiss
They throw the O and go for the dis

Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?

[Verse 3]
I met this girl by the name of Judy
Kind of cute with a real nice booty
Hard to get and likes to play tough
Cause she knows I want the funky stuff
When I spoke, she wouldn't even speak
Til she saw me in the biz that week
Took her to the movies and bought her a treat
Went to my house and made the bed squeak

Yeah that Judy puts up a fight
But I won with the X cause I rolled that night
Just when things started to feel good
We rolled a little fast and we broke the wood
My dad got up cause he heard some knockin'
Thought it was a crook me and Judy was rockin'
Came to my room opened up the door
Son whatcha doin'?
Playin Tic-Tac-Toe

Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you

How can you just leave me standing
Alone in a world that's so cold?
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father: too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied
Why do we scream at each other?
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry

Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

How can you just leave me standing

You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace

There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?

Done seen too many real players fall
To let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy, let's be honest, you a punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein' a thug?
And you can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with MAC's, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers tryin' to advance

Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love

You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers

So what's a ""chazzer,"" Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right

And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello, is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted and my arms are open wide
Cause you know just what to say and you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much, I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello, I've just got to let you know
Cause I wonder where you are and I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely? Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart, for I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying I love you

Hello

I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away
And I'm wondering why you left

And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time
Thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild

And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

And I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know
How desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world
I have no meaning
Though I'm trying hard to understand

And it's my heart that's breaking

Ay yo
This that shit you bob your head to
This that brand new instrumental
I heard he puts his city on
That boy Kells so influential
Success got everybody hating
Success to me is inspiration
Cause how we supposed to know that what we dream is possible
If don't nobody that looks like us makes it?
You only got one life, don't waste it
I mean we only got one night, get wasted
I mean I know you're trying to think it out
But go with what you feel cause real problems can't be calculated
It's hard to find the answer when they have no explanation
It's hard to find where you're headed when there's no destination
It's hard to know when we're going when there's no expiration
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

Drinking whiskey like a desperado
My bitches drinking Reposado
Ashing in an empty bottle
Listening to the songs that put our asses in this empty condo
Remember ridin' 'round in Ashleigh's car though?
When the radio first played our song though?
Or at her house when MTV first showed my face
That clip was crazy, I swear it felt like we won the lotto
But a million bucks can't buy priceless moments
An a million people may not know us
But every one of us wants this gift we own
And that is: how is how to keep it real
How to never judge somebody by their steering wheel
Cause you know that mother fucker in that Ford Taurus
Could be the next mother fucker in that new Porsche
But like I said it's hard to know where you're headed
When there's no destination
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

This shit right here, man, this shit feels right! Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it’s all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka, with my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn’t go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over"" cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could’ve died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man I’m not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like “Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now."" I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds."" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called “Chip off the Block” over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: “Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you."" I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes thats all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here

Feel that, uh

And all your dreams that you keep inside
You're telling me the secrets that you just can't hide

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep

When you close your eyes and you fall asleep
Everything about you is a mystery

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talking in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep"

Oh, the night is my world
City light painted girl
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
In the night, no control
Through the wall something's breaking
Wearing white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes, the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control
Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You help me to forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control

[Chorus]
I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes
A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go

320,Let's Go Crazy,Prince and The Revolution,Prince and,Let's Go Crazy Prince and,"[Spoken Intro]
Dearly beloved
We are gathered here today
To get through this thing called ""life""

Electric word, life
It means forever and that's a mighty long time
But I'm here to tell you
There's something else
The afterworld

A world of never ending happiness
You can always see the sun, day or night

So when you call up that shrink in Beverly Hills
You know the one, Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Instead of asking him how much of your time is left
Ask him how much of your mind, baby

Cause in this life
Things are much harder than in the after world
In this life
You're on your own

And if de-elevator tries to bring you down
Go crazy (Punch a higher floor!)

Woo!

[Verse 1]
If you don't like
The world you're living in
Take a look around
At least you got friends
You see I called my old lady
For a friendly word
She picked up the phone
Dropped it on the floor
(Ah-s ah-s) is all I heard

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no lets go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Let's look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Verse 2]
We're all excited
But we don't know why
Maybe it's cause
We're all gonna die
And when we do (when we do)
What's it all for (what's it all for)
You better live now
Before the grim reaper come knocking on your door

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, are we gonna let de-elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy
Let's get nuts
Look for the purple banana
Until they put us in the truck, let's go!

[Ad lib / Instrumental break]
C'mon baby
Let's get nuts!
Yeah
(Crazy)
Let's go crazy!

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we gonna let the elevator bring us down?
Oh, no let's go!
Go (Go crazy)

[Bridge]
I said let's go crazy (go crazy)
Let's go (Let's go!)
Go (Let's go!)

[Verse 3]
Dr. Everything'll-Be-Alright
Will make everything go wrong
Pills and thrills and daffodils will kill
Hang tough children

He's coming
He's coming
Coming

[Daryl Hall-Verse 1]

Say it isn't so painful
To tell me that you're dissatisfied
The last time I asked you, I really got a lame excuse
I know that you lied

Now wicked things can happen
You see em' goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way
That bites it even more

Tell me what you want
Yeah, I'll do it, Baby, I promise right now
Who propped you up when you were stopped
Low motivation had you on the ground?

[Daryl Hall-Pre Chorus]

I know your first reaction
You slide away
Hide Away, goodbye
But if there's a doubt, maybe I can give out
A thousand reasons why you have to say it isn't so

Now Say It isn't So

We like to be the strangers at the party
Two rebels in a shell

You like to move with the best of them
You know we, move so well

Don't need someone to lean on
I know why there's an open door
But if I'm faced with being replaced
I want you even more

Pinned to my wall

All tattered and torn

That we cry until dawn

For some perfect world
We know we'll never find

That I'd rather be
Than with you here today

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 2]
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone and...?

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

[Verse 2: Rockwell]
When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on tv see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why...

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
Well is the mailman watching me?
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now (booo! ) - the IRS?

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

Last night
I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find you
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didn't want no one to hold you
What does that mean?
And you said

Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh, no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running
And I won't touch ground
Oh, no
I got to keep on moving

You're on a roll and now you pray it'll last
The road beyond was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky

You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason
Why you're running so fast?
And she said

[Chorus]
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh, no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running
And I won't touch ground
Oh, no
I got to keep on moving

Never let another girl like you
Work me over
Never let another girl like you
Drag me under
If I meet another girl like you
I will tell her
Never want another girl like you
Have to say
Oh

Nobody gonna slow me down
Oh, no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride

Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf 99 Luftballons

99 Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister

They like it with a lot of style
But it's still that same old back beat rhythm
That really really drives 'em wild

Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll, heart of rock and roll is still beating

Forever
Another illusion
I chose to create

Until it's gone
And I found out
Alittle too late

I was acting as if
You were lucky to have me
Doing you a favor
I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone
And it was all wrong
Had no idea how much I cared

Now being without you
Takes a lot of getting used to
Should learn to live with it
But I don't want to
Being without you
It's all a big mistake
Instead of getting easier
It's the hardest thing to take
I'm addicted to you babe
You're a hard habit to break

You found somebody else
You had every reason
You know I can't blame you
For running to him
Two people together
But living alone
I was spreading my love
Too thin

After all of these years
I'm still trying to shake it
Doing much better
They say that it just takes time
But deep in the night
It's an endless fight
I can't get you out of my mind

With your eyes wide shut?
Tell me do you have faith in me
Stay
The whole night 'til you feel the sun rays. Can you
Forget everything your man sayin'
And let all of our pain be the champagne?

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly & Perrie]
Let me take the wheel from here
And penthouse suite chill from here
Show you the realest years
Stare at the skies with you
Only got eyes for you
Even when the light's off, I'm visualizing you
I see your wonder wall, I get close to you
I watch you let it fall, and get emotional
Erasing past, we are free at last
I'm beggin', please, don't play

[Chorus: Perrie & Leigh-Anne + Jade & (Jesy + Jade)]
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)
No more! (Sad songs)

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, huhn huh
Making love with each other, huhn hah

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah
From one lover to another, huhn hah

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you just walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, huhn hah
Making love with each other, huhn hah

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, huhn hah

Now I've found good loving
Gonna make it last

I tell the others
Don't bother me
Cause when they look at you
They don't see what I see

[Repeat Chorus x3:]
No, I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open
And I see the signs
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love"
371,An Innocent Man,Billy Joel,Billy Joel,An Innocent Man Billy Joel,"Some people stay far away from the door
If there's a chance of it opening up
They hear a voice in the hall outside
And hope that it just passes by

Some people live with the fear of a touch
And the anger of having been a fool
They will not listen to anyone
So nobody tells them a lie

I know you're only protecting yourself
I know you're thinking of somebody else
Someone who hurt you

But I'm not above making up for the love
You've been denying you could ever feel
I'm not above doing anything
To restore your faith if I can

Some people see through the eyes of the old
Before they ever get a look at the young
I'm only willing to hear you cry
Because I am an innocent man

[Chorus]
I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am

Some people say they will never believe
Of the promise they hear in the dark
Because they only remember too well
They heard somebody tell them before

Some people sleep all alone every night
Instead of taking a lover to bed
Some people find that it's easier to hate
Then to wait anymore

I know you don't want to hear what I say
I know you're gonna keep turning away
But I've been there

And if I can survive I can keep you alive
I'm not above going through it again
I'm not above being cool for a while
If you're cruel to me, I'll understand

Some people run from a possible fight
Some people figure they can never win
And although this is a fight I can lose
The accused is an innocent man

[Chorus]
I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am
An innocent man

You know you only hurt yourself out of spite
I guess you'd rather be a martyr tonight
That's your decision

But I'm not below anybody I know
If there's a chance of resurrecting a love
I'm not above going back to the start
To find out where the heartache began

Some people hope for a miracle cure
Some people just accept the world as it is
But I'm not willing to lay down and die
Because I am an innocent man

[Chorus]
I am an innocent man
Oh, yes I am
An innocent man, Oooh"

And take your baby by the ears
And play upon her darkest fears

You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

From the beast about to strike

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

They will possess you, unless you change that number on your dial

Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood

Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight

The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist

Is how I need you

And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for

I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time

Yo put that motherfucker on the phone..
Whassup baby? I heard you like cherry lubrication
Your girlfriend called me last night
Told me she liked to get fucked in the ass

Don't be so stiff, take your panties off
Get in the fuckin tub, here's a washcloth
Warm tea and chicken broth
My arousal, you fuckin it off
Teasin me with a thong on
You look sexy eatin popcorn
Camcorder ready your pussy is warm
Fuck rotation, listen to the quiet storm
Play with yourself in the shower, I'll be jerkin off while you gone
Stick my tongue in your ass to fight your arm
Strawberries on your clit, that's the bomb
Baby all dick in my palm
Cock your ass up and remain calm
Penetrate where you fight it
Pull your panties to the side, you like it
My chest, you lick and bite it
Hair on your pussy, don't hide it
That gets me excited
Plane flights, fuckin you in mid-air on United
Your G-strings is wet, I'm delighted

[repeat 4X]
Girl would you fuck tonight?
Suck the dick, let me lick the clit

Watch you piss in the toilet bowl
I get freaky, watch you drink milk with diapers on
Lick around the cat bowl
Pull out couch unfold, pierced belly button
With black leather boots you showin me your asshole
Lubrication grease and Pentax camera
You sold all my stamina
The way I house see
I lick your pussy from the back on the balcony
Witcha girlfriends surroundin me, watchin VHS with me
Suckin your breasts your secret fantasy
Is to suck my dick in the pickup truck, and have sex
While you bump your CD by Next
I rub my hand and face and smear sperm in your chest
Spread your legs wide, I see the pink in your pussy flesh
Open it down South, wipe my cum from around your mouth
Watch my testicles regurgitate
Fuck your girlfriend, I put fingers in her ass, she like to hate
You trust me, put on your lingerie and have faith
Condom on my dick, let's be safe

The place is crowded

Or maybe you don't like the beat
I got a two-track playing in my head
So let me take you somewhere else instead

We got the music on our side
If we go with 'em

And you knew it was gone from the very start
Do you close your eyes and dream about me

I was a younger boy all dressed in white
We're older now, Do you still think about me

I remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet
Well it felt so good to be young, feels like yesterday

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
Do you still dream about me

I guess I don't know what I'm thinking
Coming off a hard night of drinking
Angie come closer to me, I need a soul to bleed on

It coulda been done in a different kinda way
But that ain't you, you play tough when you play
It's over now, I bet you still think about me

I remember I held you so tight
And we danced the night away
With the moves of two wide-eyed kids
I need you so much today

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

I remember we learned about love in the back of a chevrolet
No good for an old memory, to mean so much today

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me
When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

When you close your eyes, do you dream about me

Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate break down the garden gate

This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need
Of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

[Verse 1]
Don't look back
Keep your head held high
Don't ask them why
Because life is short
And before you know
You're feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don't hold on to the past
Well that's too much to ask

This used to be my playground
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need
Of a friend
Why did it have to end
And why do they always say

[Verse 2]
No regrets
But I wish that you
Were here with me
Well then there's hope yet
I can see your face
In our secret place
You're not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday (the dream)
Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say)

[Chorus]
This used to be my playground (used to be)
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy
This used to be our playground
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me
This used to be our playground
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me"
421,Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough,Patty Smyth and Don Henley,Patty Smyth,Sometimes Love Just Ain't Enough Patty Smyth,"Now, I don't want to lose you
But I don't want to use you
Just to have somebody by my side
And I don't want to hate you
I don't want to take you
But I don't want to be the one to cry

And that don't really matter
To anyone anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

Now, I could never change you
I don't want to blame you
Baby, you don't have to take the fall
Yes, I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
When it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
And do you feel me beside you in your bed
There beside you where I used to lay

And there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Baby, sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby, sometimes love
It just ain't enough"

If you've got the feeling, jump up, touch the ceiling
Muggs lets the funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo, I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's ho

Anyone stepping to me, you'll get burned
'Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle, bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, 'cause I duel to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath

All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

I can't find, oh the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me (oh baby no)

But these cuts I have (cuts I have)
They need love (they need love, they need love)

You've got to live and learn

Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

Here's a little story about life
Everybody that lives surely dies

Some people have to go through so much more
Before they really learn about life's score
The subject is not to be ignored (Kick it to 'em, Joe)

To tell you how it's gotta be
Livin' is the only way

Y'all, check it
Kick this one for the Public
Now break it down

There's so much wrong and negativity
Enough for the whole world to see

It may be from the way you treat him cold
I guess that's how the story's told (Tell 'em what it is)

Why you're livin' large, are you takin' what is given
To you, in the form of true experience
'Cause if you're not your whole life could be spent
Doin' time for a crime you say you didn't even do
The only fool that you're foolin' is the fool that is you
Didn't even turn around to check and see if your bridge is burnin'
I guess it's true what they say that without livin' there's no learnin'

And this is from the J, the O, and the E

Mary, Mary, Mary, it's quite contrary
Yo', how did you earn your dough
You didn't finish school, you ain't got no job
But to the human eye it's pretty simple
You're always talkin' about what you want is respect
But never thinkin' about the little boy you neglect
Spendin' his formative years in a livin' hell
Not realizin' one day he'd end up in jail

Now on the other hand
There's Dan my man
Who planned a scam and I'll be damned
It was the ultimate flim flam
He was sayin' that it was easy as pie
But little did Dan know he was about to die

432,Humpin' Around,Bobby Brown,Bobby Brown,Humpin' Around Bobby Brown,"When you trust someone
And you know you're on their back
You ain't got no trusting about you
And you claim that you
Don't care what where I'm at
You've given me reason to doubt you
Say you trust someone
Why are you calling all around
Think I've got some dip on the side
Girl you don't trust no one
And you're constantly in doubt
You lose the game, if you play that way

[Hook]
Get up off my back
Save a heart attack
Ain't nobody Humpin' Around (Ain't nobody humpin around)
No matter what they say
No it ain't that way
Ain't nobody humpin around
Nobody [x5]
Humpin' around babe

When you love someone
And you want to love them right
Got to get more lovin' about you
And you know that you're holding on too tight
Soon they will be leaving without you
Say that you love someone
Why are you calling all my friends
Thinking I've got something to hide
Girl you don't love no one
You don't know what love's about
You lose the game, (if you) if you play that way

[Hook]

Girl when you trust someone
You don't call on everybody
Ain't nobody foolin' around
And the more I think about it
You lose all your clout
You lose the game, baby, if you play that way

[Hook]

My name is Brown
That's what I'm called
So don't try to step to be wrong
Or you'll fall slow
'Cos I just wanna get something to you
Maybe take control of you just like
I told you (I wanna roll)
On a tip that's movin
Im gonna make ya movin, grovin
Leavin ya like Ooo
When I touch ya
Give ya so much
The feeling of the effect that I'm dealin
When I rub ya up & down

[Hook]

Girl you said you love me
And you said you trust me
Why do you think I'm foolin' around
I can't stand the pressure
You know I'm yours forever
Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody humpin' around

Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
Sleep beside in empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Open up gonna come inside
Gonna fill you up
Make you cry

This bloke can't stand to see you black and blue
I give you something sweet each time you
Come inside my jungle book
It's just too good
Don't say you'll stay
Cause then you go away

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks
For me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn I wish I was your lover

If I was your girl believe me
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
We could groove along and feel much better
Let me in
I could do it forever and ever, ever n' ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in
Forever and ever and ever and ever

I sat on the mountainside with peace of mind
I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear
Walked for days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I have everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks for me there is no other
You're the only shoe that fits

To what we had?
The good times that made us laugh
Outweigh the bad

I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

I don't know where this road
Is going to lead
All I know is where we've been
And what we've been through

If we get to see tomorrow
I hope it's worth all the wait
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

And I'll take with me the memories
To be my sunshine after the rain

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo. Galileo Figaro magnifico
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go

Lord I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin up
Why does it have to be so damn tough
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

[Hook]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Verse Two]
Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes, a game of horseshoes

[Verse 3: Speech]
Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

[Hook]

[Outro: Aerle Taree]
Headliner, I won the game of horseshoes
Now you owe me a watermelon
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks
Do like they do below the border
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth"

Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen

And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on

I saw you dancing out the ocean
Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby you're the one

[Verse 2]
There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach

[Chorus]
And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Uh, baby you're the one

And all I ever needed was the one

Set adrift on memory bliss of you

The camera pans the cocktail glass
Behind a blind of plastic plants
I found the lady with the fat diamond ring
Then you know I can't remember a damn thing
I think it's one of those déjà vu things
Or a dream that's tryin' to tell me somethin'
Or will I ever stop thinkin' about it
I don't know, I doubt it
Subterranean by design
I wonder what I would find
If I met you, let my eyes caress you
Until I meet the thought of Mrs Princess Who?
I often wonder what makes her work
I guess I'll leave that question to the experts
Assuming that there are some out there
They're probably alone, solitaire
I can remember when
I caught up with a past-time intimate friend
She said, bet you're probably gonna say I look lovely
But you probably don't think nothin' of me
She was right, though, I can't lie
She's just one of those corners in my mind
And I just put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

[Hook]
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

[Verse 2]
A careless whisper from a careless man
A neutron dance for a neutron fan
Marionette strings are dangerous things
I thought of all the trouble they bring
An eye for an eye, a spy for spy
Rubber bands expand in a frustrating sigh
Tell me that she's not dreaming
She's got an ace in the hole, it doesn't have meaning
Reality used to be a friend of mine
Cause complete control, I don't take too kind
Christina Applegate, you gotta put me on
And guess whose piece of the cake is Jack gone?
She broke her wishbone and wished for a sign
I told her whispers in my heart were fine
What did she think she could do?
I feel for her, I really do
And I stared at the ring finger on her hand
I wanted her to be a big PM Dawn fan
But I had to put her right back with the rest
That's the way it goes, I guess

[Hook]
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you
Baby you send me, baby you send me
Set adrift on memory bliss of you

Saw the man inside

We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

And never came home

Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear [Boo !]
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me ?
Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me

[Hook]
I am everyday people (2x)

[Verse 2: Speech]
I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

[Hook]

The moral of the story is you better look very hard at who you're stepping to, cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it. Africans need to be loving each other and unite"
467,No Son of Mine,Genesis,Genesis,No Son of Mine Genesis,"The key to my survival
Was never in much doubt
The question was how I could keep sane
Trying to find a way out

Things were never easy for me
Peace of mind was hard to find
And I needed a place where I could hide
Somewhere I could call mine

I didn't think much about it
Til it started happening all the time
Soon I was living with the fear everyday
Of what might happen at night

I couldn't stand to hear the
Crying of my mother
And I remember when
I swore that, that would be the
Last they'd see of me
And I never went home again

They say time is a healer
And knew my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straght in the eyes
He said:

You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it

You're no son, no son of mine
But where should I go
And what should I do
You're no son, no son of mine
But I came here for help, I came here for you

Well the years they passed slowly
I thought about him everyday
What would I do, if we passed on the street
Would I keep running away

In and out of hiding places
Soon I'd have to face the facts
We'd have to sit down and talk it over
And that would mean going back

They say time is a healer
And now my wounds are not the same
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth
I had to hear what he'd say

He sat me down to talk to me
He looked me straght in the eyes
He said:

You're no son, no son of mine
You're no son, no son of mine
You walked out, you left us behind
And you're no son, no son of mine

Huh yeah let me introduce y'all to the wildside
Annie was a high school cheerleader
Pom poms and bobby socks and no girl was sweeter
Come prom time everybody was on the line
All the fellas singing nickel and dime
Tales about love and lust and trust
But Annie took it in all in stride
Cause deep inside annie had aspirations
Wanted to be a chemical engineer
Making 50 to 55 thousand a year
Her first year of college was a success
But along came Billy possessed and obsessed
He took Annie on a fatal date
And showed her things that made heart beats accelerate
Annie took a hit breathed two short breaths
One for life the last for death
Now she's gone a former valedictorian
Ended up becoming a topic for historians
Washed up dreams, shattered pride
All because Annie took a hit on the wildside

(Chorus)

Ron had enough of being broke every day
Saying to himself. There's gotta be a better way
Cause 9 to 5 wasn't worth the headaches
So ron figured out a faster way to make money
Before you know it, he's a rich man
Gold on every finger of his hand
A brand new BMW. A condo. Ron ended up a john doe
A body was found in the alley but never claimed
Full of bullet holes but none to blame
Ron became another victim of homicide
Because he chose to walk on the wildside

(Chorus)

Charles had everything going for him
A top paying job a good life. A good wife
A baby boy on the way any day
A gentleman attitude is all he displayed
Carol was the wife he loved and adored
Her family and friends treated him like an ambassador
One night on the other side of town
A police dispatcher picked up a weird sound
Charles on the car phone asking for help
Claiming a burglar shot his wife and himself
His pregnant wife lay slumped over
Dreams corrupt and a young life over
Extensive searches throughout the projects
Put a lot of people through misery and wreck
Everyone a suspect till someone was found
Interrogated cause their skin was brown
Then there was Benny, guilty until proven so
But soon as the case started moving slow
What do you know, sure as a sea gull gets webbed toed
Charles was the culprit
The whole plot was an insurance scam
Charles and his brother came up with a plan
Kill carol collect a big check
Blame it on a black man. What the heck!
And just before the story was known
Charles had a feeling his cover was blown
So he jumped off a bridge
Committed suicide
This is how it is on the wildside!

(Chorus)

Little Tiffany. Only thirteen
Came to the city. Place of big dreams
Visiting family and friends for the summer time
Sitting on a mailbox, watching the boys climb trees
And the girls play hopscotch
So far her vacation was top notch
But of the blue a Mercedes at top speed
Gang bangers chasing the robbers on the stampede
Quick as a blink shots rang out loud
And a hail of bullets zipped through the crowd
One hit Tiffany and instantly she died
Innocently on the wildside"

Set for the night so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, rolling striking through to be seen

Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin kinda funky

But that's just a figure of speech to me
They tell me I changed because I got money
But if you were there before then you're still down with me, yeah

[Chorus]
What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends
Are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around
Or will they turn their backs on you

[Refrain: Left Eye]
Well is it me or can it be I'm a little too
Friendly so to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Every now and then I get a little easy
I let a lot of people depend on me
I never thought they would ever deceive me
Don't you know when times got rough
I was standing on my own
I'll never let another get that close to me
You see I've grown a lot smarter now
Sometimes you have to choose and then you'll see
If your friend is true they'll be there with you
Through the thick and thin

[Chorus]
What about your friends (What about your friends)
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again (let you down again)
What about your friends (What about your friends)
Are they gonna be low down (Be low down)
Will they ever be around (be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you

[Refrain: Left Eye]
Yo is it me, here we go
Is it me or can it be I am a little too friendly
So to speak hypothetically say
I supply creativity to what others
Must take as a form of self-hate
Only to make an enemy
Which results in unfortunate destiny
They dog me out then be next to me
Just cause I am what some choose to envy

[Chorus]
What about your friends
Will they stand their ground, yeah
Will they let you down again
What about your friends
Are they gonna be low down (What about your friends)
Will they ever be around (be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you

[Bridge: Chili]
People say I act a little funny
I wouldn't change not for no money
I'll be a friend as long as you're a friend to me yeah yeah (What about your friends)
Even though I might seem easy
It don't give you no cause to deceive me
It's not the way that I want my friends to ever be

[Chorus]
What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends (What about your friends)
Are they gonna be low down (Be low down)
Will they ever be around (Will they ever be around)
Or will they turn their backs on you (Or will they turn their backs on you)

What about your friends
Will they stand their ground
Will they let you down again
What about your friends
Are they gonna be low down
Will they ever be around"

Sometimes we make it harder than it is
We'll take a perfect night
And fill it up with words we don't mean
Dark sides best unseen
And we wonder why we're feeling this way

Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same
Why we can be unkind
Questioning the strongest of hearts
That's when we must start
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more
Baby, that's what love is for

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I see you
And you don't know I am there
And I'm washed away
By emotions I hold deep down inside
Getting stronger with time
It's living through the fire
And holding on we find

That's what love is for
To help us through it
That's what love is for
Nothing else can do it
Melt our defenses
Bring us back to our senses
Give us strength to try once more

Believing in the one thing
That has gotten us this far

Why should I try, I don't want to get over you

Where is our yesterday
You and I could use it right now
But if this is goodbye...

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go

Here we are about to take the final step now
I just can't fool myself, I know there's no turning back
Face to face it's been an endless conversation
But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk

I'd give my everything
If only I could turn you around
But if this is goodbye...

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go"

I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothing, in fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day but daddy don't agree
Because when I try to get away, he says, he got plans for me
""Get your butt right out of bed""
Stop bugging me
""Get up and move your sleepy head""
Don't shake my tree
He said, ""Mow the lawn"", who me?
""Walk the dog"", not my style, man
""Take out the trash"", no way
""Tidy your room"", come on, get real
Sorry Dad, got to disappear
Let's get the rock out of here

Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins

Well, I'm sorry, girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question

Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me

I had a dream, I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

[Verse 2]
As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
A helping hand - someone who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got someone there to say
I'll show you

[Chorus]
Say you, say me
Say it for always, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

So you think you know the answers - oh no
Because the whole world has got you dancing, that's right
I'm telling you
It's time to start believing - oh yes
Believing who you are - you are a shining star

Say it for always, that's the way it should be

Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say
That I loved you
Then I realized that
It was just my mind playing tricks on me

It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe
That we're through

[Chorus:]
I miss you
(I miss you)
There's no other way to say it
And I
And I can't deny it

I miss you
(I miss you)
It's so easy to see
I miss you and me

Is it done
And over this time?
Can we ever change our minds?

But it's our first love
All the feelings that we used to share
I refuse to believe
That you don't care

I've got to gather my senses together
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now
(Over now)
Be strong

I've got to carry on

Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations

Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says stop his spirit cries - never!
Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

Somewhere between the soul and soft machine
Is where I find myself again

Would I have followed down my chosen road
Or only wished what I could be

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
A good kind of love, want a higher love

I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along

Bring it, oh

{Bridge}

I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be

Oh

{Bridge }

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of?

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh bring me
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh I said bring me
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love

Save some light for me
Figures up ahead
Moving in the trees
White skin in linen
Perfume on my wrist
And the full moon that hangs over
These dreams in the mist
Darkness on the edge
Shadows where I stand
I search for the time
On a watch with no hands
I want to see you clearly
Come closer than this
But all I remember
Are the dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

Is it cloak 'n dagger
Could it be spring or fall
I walk without a cut
Through a stained glass wall
Weaker in my eyesight
The candle in my grip
And words that have no form
Are falling from my lips

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

There's something out there
I can't resist
I need to hide away from the pain
There's something out there
I can't resist
The sweetest song is silence
That I've ever heard
Funny how your feet
In dreams never touch the earth
In a wood full of princes
Freedom is a kiss
But the prince hides his face
From dreams in the mist

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away

These dreams go on when I close my eyes
Every second of the night I live another life
These dreams that sleep when it's cold outside
Every moment I'm awake the further I'm away"

We're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Yes, I see
Your expression when the phone rings
We both know
There's something happening here

There's no sense
In dancing 'round the subject
A wound gets worse
When it's treated with neglect
Well, don't turn now
There's nothing here to fear

You can talk to me
Talk to me
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby

Dusty words
Lying under carpets
Seldom heard
Well, must you keep your secrets
Locked inside
Hidden deep from view

Do I seem all that hard
Is it all that tough
Well, I've searched
Through all my cards
Well, isn't that enough
You can hide your hurt
But there's something you can do

You can talk to me
You can talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
T-t-talk to me

Though we lay face to face
And cheek to cheek
Our voices stray
From common ground where they could meet
The walls run high
To veil a swelling tear
(Tear, tear, tear)

Let the walls burn down
Set your secret free
You can break their bounds
'Cause you're safe with me
You can lose your doubt
'Cause you'll find no danger here

You can talk to me
Talk to me
When you're down now
You can talk to me
You can set your secrets free, baby

Well, I can see
That expression when the phone rings
And I can see
That we're thinkin' 'bout the same things
Is it all that hard?
Is it all that tough?
Well, now you've taken all my dreams
Isn't that enough?

Well I can see you, baby
Well I can see you, baby
Talk to me, yeah
Well, I can see
That expression when the phone rings"

Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying

And you
Don't you know
My tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire
'Cause I'm tired of your lies

All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy
That you could not hear my cry

I
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain

And you
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out over you

Oh, you
All over you
Ooh

Never wanted to see things your way
I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool?

Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone

Don't you know
The hurt will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames
Why should I take the blame?

You were the one who left me neglected
(I'm so sorry)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected

Oh, I gave you all of me
(Gave me all of you)
How was I to know you would weaken so easily
I, I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out

Your sense of justice i'll embrace
But your defense don't help my case
I'm deep in trouble with the law
Something about authority
Seems to bring out the bad in me
Hey lawyer got to catch me when i fall
Oh they say that you match your wits
With the best of them
But i know when i'm close you're just
Like the rest of them

[Chorus]
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

[Bridge]
So put your books aside
Loosen off the suit and tie
And open up your heart and let me in
Now open up your heart and let me in

[Chorus]
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

[Bridge]
The reaction
I'm just using my feminine charm
On a typical male, on a typical

[Chorus]
All I want is a little reaction
Just enough of to tip the scales
I'm just using my female attraction
On a typical male, on a typical male

A little reaction
I'm just using my female attraction"
571,Small Town,John Cougar Mellencamp,John Cougar,Small Town John Cougar,"Well, I was born in a small town
And I live in a small town
Probably die in a small town
Oh, those small communities

All my friends are so small town
My parents live in the same small town
My job is so small town
Provides little opportunity

Educated in a small town
Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic that's me

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me

No, I cannot forget where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be

Got nothing against a big town
Still hayseed enough to say
Look who's in the big town
But my bed is in a small town
Oh, and that's good enough for me

Well, I was born in a small town
And I can breathe in a small town
Gonna die in this small town
And that's probably where they'll bury me"

But these wicked women
Ooh, they just persist

Maybe you think it’s cute
But girl, I’m not impressed
I tell you one time only with my business
Please don’t mess

Look at all these rumors
Surrounding me every day
I just need some time
Some time to get away from

From all these rumors
I can’t take it no more
My best friend said there’s one out now
About me and the girl next door

Hear the one about Tina
Some say she’s much too loose
That came straight from a guy
Who claims he’s tasted her juice
Did you hear the one about Michael
Some say he must be gay
I tried to argue, but they said
If he was straight he wouldn’t move that way

Did you hear that one about Susan, some say she’s just a tease
In a camisole, she’s six feet tall, she’ll knock you to your knees

I’ll think I’ll write my congressman
And tell him to pass a bill

Shoot to kill

I can see the future

Is there nothing that I can say
To make you change your mind?
I watch the world go round and round
And see mine turnin' upside down

Throwing it all away

Now who will light up your darkness?
And who will hold your hand?
Who will find you the answers
When you don't understand?

Why should I have to be the one
Who has to convince you?
Cause you know I know baby
That I don't wanna go

Then some day you'll be sorry
Someday when you're free
Memories will remind you
That our love was meant to be

But late at night when you call my name
The only sound you'll hear
Is the sound of your voice calling
Calling out to me

Just throwing it all away
Throwing it all away
And there's nothing that I can say
Hey...

We're throwing it all away

Just a throwing it all away

In your little corner of the world
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow

[Chorus]
Oh Nikita You will never know anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita I need you so
Oh Nikita is the other side of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita you'll never know

[Verse 2]
Do you ever dream of me
Do you ever see the letters that I write
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

[Chorus][x2]"
587,Take Me Home,Phil Collins,Phil Collins,Take Me Home Phil Collins,"[Verse 1]
Take that look of worry
I'm an ordinary man
They don't tell me nothing
So I find out all I can
There's a fire that's been burning
Right outside my door
I can't see but I feel it
And it helps to keep me warm

[Refrain 1]
So, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

[Verse 2]
Seems so long I've been waiting
Still don't know what for
There's no point in escaping
I don't worry anymore
I can't come out to find you
I don't like to go outside
They can turn off my feelings
Like they're turning off the light

[Refrain 2]
But, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
Oh, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

[Chorus]
So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh lord
'Cause I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you

[Verse 3]
Take that look of worry
Mine's an ordinary life
Working when it's daylight
And sleeping when it's night
I've got no far horizons
I don't wish upon a star
They don't think that I listen
Oh, but I know who they are

[Refrain 3]
And, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind
Oh, I... I don't mind
No, I... I don't mind

[Chorus]
So take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home, oh Lord

[Bridge]
Well I've been a prisoner all my life
And I can say to you, but I don't remember

[Outro]
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home

Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home
'Cause I don't remember
Take, take me home

[Verse 1 : Run-D.M.C]
Now there's a backseat lover, that's always undercover
And we talk 'til my daddy say
Said you ain't seen nothing, 'til you're down on a muffin
And there's sure to be a change in ways
Now there's a cheerleader, that's a real big breeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving, was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this!

{*Joe Perry plays guitar riff*}

[Hook : Run-D.M.C]
See-saw swinging, with the boys in school
And her feet are just fly up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle""
And they swinging like it just didn't care
So I took a big chance, At the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me, she was foolin'
Cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way!
She told me to

[Chorus : Steven Tyler]
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
(She told me to)
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way

Well just gimme a kiss

{*Joe Perry plays guitar riff*}
Oooh, like this!

[Verse 2: Run-D.M.C]
School girl sleazy with a classy kind of sassy
Little skirt climbing way up her knee
It was three young ladies, in the school gym locker
And they find they were looking at D
I was high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til a boy told me something I missed
That my next door neighbor, had a daughter had a favor
So I gave the girl a little kiss, like this

[Hook : Run-D.M.C., Steven Tyler and Rick Rubin]
See-saw swinging with the boys in the school
With her feet flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle, with a kitty in the middle""
I was swinging like I didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
When she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way

And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays

Once beneath the stars
The universe was ours

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that

Rain comes down, moving your way fast
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

You turn a corner and you see a door
Walk on through, throw yourself on the floor
Oh, when you're looking up, it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with movie star eyes

You think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that'll see you through
And I say there ain't no way

Turn a different corner and we never would have met

Don't you care
No I've never come close in all of these years

She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so
Tell me so baby

He's acting shy looking for an answer
Come on honey let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on honey tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know

His heart's beating like a drum
'cos at last he's got this girl home
Relax baby now we are all alone

They wake at dawn 'cos all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other neither one's complaining
He say's I sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie

I was a fool to ever leave your side
Me minus you is such a lonely ride
The breakup we had
Has made me lonesome and sad
I realize I love you cause
I want you back, hey, hey

I spent the evening with the radio
Regret the moment that I let you go
Our quarrel was such
A way of learning so much
I know now that I love you
Cause I need your touch, hey, hey

And it feels so good
Reunited
Cause we understood

There`s one perfect fit
And sugar, this one is it
We both are so excited
Cause we`re reunited
Hey, hey

I sat here staring
At the same old wall
Came back to life just when I got your call

I wished I could climb right
Through the telephone line
And give you what you want
So you will still be mine
Hey, hey

I can't go cheating
Honey, I can't play
I found it very hard to stay away

As we reminisce on
Precious moments like this
I`m glad we`re back together
Cause I missed your kiss
Hey, hey

There`s one perfect fit

And it feels so good
Reunited

605,I Will Survive,Gloria Gaynor,Gloria Gaynor,I Will Survive Gloria Gaynor,"At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now go, walk out the door, just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive

It took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying with all my mind to mend my broken heart
I spent, so many nights feeling sorry for myself
Oh, I used to cry but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
Not that lonely little person still in love with you
Now you come dropping in expecting me to be free
Now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live, and all my love to give
And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive
Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive

Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint-hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies

ONE MORNING, very early, I heard Mrs. Todd in the garden outside my window. By the unusual loudness of her remarks to a passer-by, and the notes of a familiar hymn which she sang as she worked among the herbs, and which came as if directed purposely to the sleepy ears of my consciousness, I knew that she wished I would wake up and come and speak to her.

In a few minutes she responded to a morning voice from behind the blinds. “I expect you're goin' up to your schoolhouse to pass all this pleasant day; yes, I expect you're goin' to be dreadful busy,” she said despairingly.

“Perhaps not,” said I. “Why, what's going to be the matter with you, Mrs. Todd?” For I supposed that she was tempted by the fine weather to take one of her favorite expeditions along the shore pastures to gather herbs and simples, and would like to have me keep the house.

“No, I don't want to go nowhere by land,” she answered gayly,—”no, not by land; but I don't know's we shall have a better day all the rest of the summer to go out to Green Island an' see mother. I waked up early thinkin' of her. The wind's light northeast,—'twill take us right straight out, an' this time o' year it's liable to change round southwest an' fetch us home pretty, 'long late in the afternoon. Yes, it's goin' to be a good day.”

“Speak to the captain and the Bowden boy, if you see anybody going by toward the landing,” said I. “We'll take the big boat.”

“Oh, my sakes! now you let me do things my way,” said Mrs. Todd scornfully. “No, dear, we won't take no big bo't. I'll just git a handy dory, an' Johnny Bowden an' me, we'll man her ourselves. I don't want no abler bo't than a good dory, an' a nice light breeze ain't goin' to make no sea; an' Johnny's my cousin's son,—mother'll like to have him come; an' he'll be down to the herrin' weirs all the time we're there, anyway; we don't want to carry no men folks havin' to be considered every minute an' takin' up all our time. No, you let me do; we'll just slip out an' see mother by ourselves. I guess what breakfast you'll want's about ready now.”

I had become well acquainted with Mrs. Todd as landlady, herb-gatherer, and rustic philosopher; we had been discreet fellow-passengers once or twice when I had sailed up the coast to a larger town than Dunnet Landing to do some shopping; but I was yet to become acquainted with her as a mariner. An hour later we pushed off from the landing in the desired dory. The tide was just on the turn, beginning to fall, and several friends and acquaintances stood along the side of the dilapidated wharf and cheered us by their words and evident interest. Johnny Bowden and I were both rowing in haste to get out where we could catch the breeze and put up the small sail which lay clumsily furled along the gunwale. Mrs. Todd sat aft, a stern and unbending lawgiver.

“You better let her drift; we'll get there 'bout as quick; the tide'll take her right out from under these old buildin's; there's plenty wind outside.”

“Your bo't ain't trimmed proper, Mis' Todd!” exclaimed a voice from shore. “You're lo'ded so the bo't'll drag; you can't git her before the wind, ma'am. You set 'midships, Mis' Todd, an' let the boy hold the sheet 'n' steer after he gits the sail up; you won't never git out to Green Island that way. She's lo'ded bad, your bo't is,—she's heavy behind's she is now!”

Mrs. Todd turned with some difficulty and regarded the anxious adviser, my right oar flew out of water, and we seemed about to capsize. “That you, Asa? Good-mornin',” she said politely. “I al'ays liked the starn seat best. When'd you git back from up country?”

This allusion to Asa's origin was not lost upon the rest of the company. We were some little distance from shore, but we could hear a chuckle of laughter, and Asa, a person who was too ready with his criticism and advice on every possible subject, turned and walked indignantly away.

When we caught the wind we were soon on our seaward course, and only stopped to underrun a trawl, for the floats of which Mrs. Todd looked earnestly, explaining that her mother might not be prepared for three extra to dinner; it was her brother's trawl, and she meant to just run her eye along for the right sort of a little haddock. I leaned over the boat's side with great interest and excitement, while she skillfully handled the long line of hooks, and made scornful remarks upon worthless, bait-consuming creatures of the sea as she reviewed them and left them on the trawl or shook them off into the waves. At last we came to what she pronounced a proper haddock, and having taken him on board and ended his life resolutely, we went our way.

As we sailed along I listened to an increasingly delightful commentary upon the islands, some of them barren rocks, or at best giving sparse pasturage for sheep in the early summer. On one of these an eager little flock ran to the water's edge and bleated at us so affectingly that I would willingly have stopped; but Mrs. Todd steered away from the rocks, and scolded at the sheep's mean owner, an acquaintance of hers, who grudged the little salt and still less care which the patient creatures needed. The hot midsummer sun makes prisons of these small islands that are a paradise in early June, with their cool springs and short thick-growing grass. On a larger island, farther out to sea, my entertaining companion showed me with glee the small houses of two farmers who shared the island between them, and declared that for three generations the people had not spoken to each other even in times of sickness or death or birth. “When the news come that the war was over, one of 'em knew it a week, and never stepped across his wall to tell the other,” she said. “There, they enjoy it; they've got to have somethin' to interest 'em in such a place; 'tis a good deal more tryin' to be tied to folks you don't like than 'tis to be alone. Each of 'em tell the neighbors their wrongs; plenty likes to hear and tell again; them as fetch a bone'll carry one, an' so they keep the fight a-goin'. I must say I like variety myself; some folks washes Monday an' irons Tuesday the whole year round, even if the circus is goin' by!”

A long time before we landed at Green Island we could see the small white house, standing high like a beacon, where Mrs. Todd was born and where her mother lived, on a green slope above the water, with dark spruce woods still higher. There were crops in the fields, which we presently distinguished from one another. Mrs. Todd examined them while we were still far at sea. “Mother's late potatoes looks backward; ain't had rain enough so far,” she pronounced her opinion. “They look weedier than what they call Front Street down to Cowper Centre. I expect brother William is so occupied with his herrin' weirs an' servin' out bait to the schooners that he don't think once a day of the land.”

“What's the flag for, up above the spruces there behind the house?” I inquired, with eagerness.

“Oh, that's the sign for herrin',” she explained kindly, while Johnny Bowden regarded me with contemptuous surprise. “When they get enough for schooners they raise that flag; an' when 'tis a poor catch in the weir pocket they just fly a little signal down by the shore, an' then the small bo'ts comes and get enough an' over for their trawls. There, look! there she is: mother sees us; she's wavin' somethin' out o' the fore door! She'll be to the landin'-place quick's we are.”

I looked, and could see a tiny flutter in the doorway, but a quicker signal had made its way from the heart on shore to the heart on the sea.

“How do you suppose she knows it is me?” said Mrs. Todd, with a tender smile on her broad face. “There, you never get over bein' a child long's you have a mother to go to. Look at the chimney, now; she's gone right in an' brightened up the fire. Well, there, I'm glad mother's well; you'll enjoy seein' her very much.”

Mrs. Todd leaned back into her proper position, and the boat trimmed again. She took a firmer grasp of the sheet, and gave an impatient look up at the gaff and the leech of the little sail, and twitched the sheet as if she urged the wind like a horse. There came at once a fresh gust, and we seemed to have doubled our speed. Soon we were near enough to see a tiny figure with handkerchiefed head come down across the field and stand waiting for us at the cove above a curve of pebble beach.

Presently the dory grated on the pebbles, and Johnny Bowden, who had been kept in abeyance during the voyage, sprang out and used manful exertions to haul us up with the next wave, so that Mrs. Todd could make a dry landing.

“You don that very well,” she said, mounting to her feet, and coming ashore somewhat stiffly, but with great dignity, refusing our outstretched hands, and returning to possess herself of a bag which had lain at her feet.

“Well, mother, here I be!” she announced with indifference; but they stood and beamed in each other's faces.

“Lookin' pretty well for an old lady, ain't she?” said Mrs. Todd's mother, turning away from her daughter to speak to me. She was a delightful little person herself, with bright eyes and an affectionate air of expectation like a child on a holiday. You felt as if Mrs. Blackett were an old and dear friend before you let go her cordial hand. We all started together up the hill.

“Now don't you haste too fast, mother,” said Mrs. Todd warningly; “'tis a far reach o' risin' ground to the fore door, and you won't set an' get your breath when you're once there, but go trotting about. Now don't you go a mite faster than we proceed with this bag an' basket. Johnny, there, 'll fetch up the haddock. I just made one stop to underrun William's trawl till I come to jes' such a fish's I thought you'd want to make one o' your nice chowders of. I've brought an onion with me that was layin' about on the window-sill at home.”

“That's just what I was wantin',” said the hostess. “I give a sigh when you spoke o' chowder, knowin' my onions was out. William forgot to replenish us last time he was to the Landin'. Don't you haste so yourself Almiry, up this risin' ground. I hear you commencin' to wheeze a'ready.”

This mild revenge seemed to afford great pleasure to both giver and receiver. They laughed a little, and looked at each other affectionately, and then at me. Mrs. Todd considerately paused, and faced about to regard the wide sea view. I was glad to stop, being more out of breath than either of my companions, and I prolonged the halt by asking the names of the neighboring islands. There was a fine breeze blowing, which we felt more there on the high land than when we were running before it in the dory.

“Why, this ain't that kitten I saw when I was out last, the one that I said didn't appear likely?” exclaimed Mrs. Todd as we went our way.

“That's the one, Almiry,” said her mother. “She always had a likely look to me, an' she's right after business. I never see such a mouser for one of her age. If't wan't for William, I never should have housed that other dronin' old thing so long; but he sets by her on account of her havin' a bob tail. I don't deem it advisable to maintain cats just on account of their havin' bob tails; they're like all other curiosities, good for them that wants to see 'm twice. This kitten catches mice for both, an' keeps me respectable as I ain't been for a year. She's a real understandin' little help, this kitten is. I picked her from among five Miss Augusta Pernell had over to Burnt Island,” said the old woman, trudging along with the kitten close at her skirts. “Augusta, she says to me, 'Why, Mis' Blackett, you've took and homeliest;' and, says I, 'I've got the smartest; I'm satisfied.'“

“I'd trust nobody sooner'n you to pick out a kitten, mother,” said the daughter handsomely, and we went on in peace and harmony.

The house was just before us now, on a green level that looked as if a huge hand had scooped it out of the long green field we had been ascending. A little way above, the dark, spruce woods began to climb the top of the hill and cover the seaward slopes of the island. There was just room for the small farm and the forest; we looked down at the fish-house and its rough sheds, and the weirs stretching far out into the water. As we looked upward, the tops of the firs came sharp against the blue sky. There was a great stretch of rough pasture-land round the shoulder of the island to the eastward, and here were all the thick-scattered gray rocks that kept their places, and the gray backs of many sheep that forever wandered and fed on the thin sweet pasturage that fringed the ledges and made soft hollows and strips of green turf like growing velvet. I could see the rich green of bayberry bushes here and there, where the rocks made room. The air was very sweet; one could not help wishing to be a citizen of such a complete and tiny continent and home of fisherfolk.

The house was broad and clean, with a roof that looked heavy on its low walls. It was one of the houses that seem firm-rooted in the ground, as if they were two-thirds below the surface, like icebergs. The front door stood hospitably open in expectation of company, and an orderly vine grew at each side; but our path led to the kitchen door at the house-end, and there grew a mass of gay flowers and greenery, as if they had been swept together by some diligent garden broom into a tangled heap: there were portulacas all along under the lower step and straggling off into the grass, and clustering mallows that crept as near as they dared, like poor relations. I saw the bright eyes and brainless little heads of two half-grown chickens who were snuggled down among the mallows as if they had been chased away from the door more than once, and expected to be again.

“It seems kind o' formal comin' in this way,” said Mrs. Todd impulsively, as we passed the flowers and came to the front doorstep; but she was mindful of the proprieties, and walked before us into the best room on the left.

“Why, mother, if you haven't gone an' turned the carpet!” she exclaimed, with something in her voice that spoke of awe and admiration. “When'd you get to it? I s'pose Mis' Addicks come over an' helped you, from White Island Landing?”

“No, she didn't,” answered the old woman, standing proudly erect, and making the most of a great moment. “I done it all myself with William's help. He had a spare day, an' took right holt with me; an' 'twas all well beat on the grass, an' turned, an' put down again afore we went to bed. I ripped an' sewed over two o' them long breadths. I ain't had such a good night's sleep for two years.”

“There, what do you think o' havin' such a mother as that for eighty-six year old?” said Mrs. Todd, standing before us like a large figure of Victory.

As for the mother, she took on a sudden look of youth; you felt as if she promised a great future, and was beginning, not ending, her summers and their happy toils.

“My, my!” exclaimed Mrs. Todd. “I couldn't ha' done it myself, I've got to own it.”

“I was much pleased to have it off my mind,” said Mrs. Blackett, humbly; “the more so because along at the first of the next week I wasn't very well. I suppose it may have been the change of weather.”

Mrs. Todd could not resist a significant glance at me, but, with charming sympathy, she forbore to point the lesson or to connect this illness with its apparent cause. She loomed larger than ever in the little old-fashioned best room, with its few pieces of good furniture and pictures of national interest. The green paper curtains were stamped with conventional landscapes of a foreign order,—castles on inaccessible crags, and lovely lakes with steep wooded shores; under-foot the treasured carpet was covered thick with home-made rugs. There were empty glass lamps and crystallized bouquets of grass and some fine shells on the narrow mantelpiece.

“I was married in this room,” said Mrs. Todd unexpectedly; and I heard her give a sigh after she had spoken, as if she could not help the touch of regret that would forever come with all her thoughts of happiness.

“We stood right there between the windows,” she added, “and the minister stood here. William wouldn't come in. He was always odd about seein' folks, just's he is now. I run to meet 'em from a child, an' William, he'd take an' run away.”

“I've been the gainer,” said the old mother cheerfully. “William has been son an' daughter both since you was married off the island. He's been 'most too satisfied to stop at home 'long o' his old mother, but I always tell 'em I'm the gainer.”

We were all moving toward the kitchen as if by common instinct. The best room was too suggestive of serious occasions, and the shades were all pulled down to shut out the summer light and air. It was indeed a tribute to Society to find a room set apart for her behests out there on so apparently neighborless and remote an island. Afternoon visits and evening festivals must be few in such a bleak situation at certain seasons of the year, but Mrs. Blackett was of those who do not live to themselves, and who have long since passed the line that divides mere self-concern from a valued share in whatever Society can give and take. There were those of her neighbors who never had taken the trouble to furnish a best room, but Mrs. Blackett was one who knew the uses of a parlor.

“Yes, do come right out into the old kitchen; I shan't make any stranger of you,” she invited us pleasantly, after we had been properly received in the room appointed to formality. “I expect Almiry, here, 'll be driftin' out 'mongst the pasture-weeds quick's she can find a good excuse. 'Tis hot now. You'd better content yourselves till you get nice an' rested, an' 'long after dinner the sea-breeze 'll spring up, an' then you can take your walks, an' go up an' see the prospect from the big ledge. Almiry'll want to show off everything there is. Then I'll get you a good cup o' tea before you start to go home. The days are plenty long now.”

While we were talking in the best room the selected fish had been mysteriously brought up from the shore, and lay all cleaned and ready in an earthen crock on the table.

“I think William might have just stopped an' said a word,” remarked Mrs. Todd, pouting with high affront as she caught sight of it. “He's friendly enough when he comes ashore, an' was remarkable social the last time, for him.”

“He ain't disposed to be very social with the ladies,” explained William's mother, with a delightful glance at me, as if she counted upon my friendship and tolerance. “He's very particular, and he's all in his old fishin'-clothes to-day. He'll want me to tell him everything you said and done, after you've gone. William has very deep affections. He'll want to see you, Almiry. Yes, I guess he'll be in by an' by.”

“I'll search for him by 'n' by, if he don't,” proclaimed Mrs. Todd, with an air of unalterable resolution. “I know all of his burrows down 'long the shore. I'll catch him by hand 'fore he knows it. I've got some business with William, anyway. I brought forty-two cents with me that was due him for them last lobsters he brought in.”

“You can leave it with me,” suggested the little old mother, who was already stepping about among her pots and pans in the pantry, and preparing to make the chowder.

I became possessed of a sudden unwonted curiosity in regard to William, and felt that half the pleasure of my visit would be lost if I could not make his interesting acquaintance."

He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fool don't see
Tryin' hard to recreate
What had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say
Only to realize it never really was

She had a place in his life
He never made her think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He's watching her go

But what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power to reason away
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing
Than nothing at all

Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
Where he can still believe there's a place in her life
Someday, somewhere
She will return

Used to hate to leave me

When it's good for you

And you turn out the light

To talk about forever
But 'used to be's' don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
'Til we sweep them away

And made each one come true
Something no one else had ever found a way to do
I've kept the memories one by one
Since you took me in
I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on

A fool will lose tomorrow
Reaching back for yesterday
I won't turn my head in sorrow
If you should go away

I'll stand here and remember
Just how good it's been
And I know I'll never love this way again

I know I'll never love this way again
So I keep holding on before the good is gone
I know I'll never love this way again
Hold on, hold on, hold on"

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, oh what you're trying to do?

Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're
Driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in

Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way

What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm

Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out

I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die

[Outro]
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out

My heart hanging out

What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?

Loves you inside and out

For awhile, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
In our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

Something happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

[Chorus]
And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
Till sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love into

639,The Gambler,Kenny Rogers,Kenny Rogers,The Gambler Kenny Rogers,"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life, out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run

I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so boring, filled with out-of-towners touring

At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance but not conceit, as a man he is complete
My crème de la crème, please take me home
He wears the finest clothes, the best designers, heaven knows
Oooh, from his head down to his toes

646,She Believes in Me,Kenny Rogers,Kenny Rogers,She Believes in Me Kenny Rogers,"While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way...

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true...

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me"

648,Music Box Dancer,Frank Mills,Frank Mills,Music Box Dancer Frank Mills,"You walk in the room and you're wearing a frown
You reach for the shelf and cradle it down
The Music Box Dancer, what does it prove
Only that you need to see a statue that moves
A tutu of satin, bordered with lace
Slender lines, agile legs, a wonderland face
Her beauty is balanced, an immovable pose
Eternally destined to remain on her toes

Music Box Dancer, she is only a toy
Project upon her your dreams of wanting life's joy
She's perched on her stand, and never will part
A final gaze upon her, now the music will start

You wind the doll up, it's nostalgic because
You've been here before, so give one final pause
To dream of the future, to reflect on the past
Music Box Dancer start your whirling at last

The room fills with music, such a cute song
Watching her go 'round and 'round, she's where she belongs
Bring joy to the watchers, spreading a glow
Whenever wound up, she'll put on a good show

Music Box Dancer, do you think or believe
She could step off her box if she wanted to leave
So easy it is, twirl around with such grace
Staying in her circle, she remains in one place

Such a brief moment, a small time to spend
The dancing will slow soon, the music will end
In real life we're plastic, nature's unfair
How can we breathe life, how can we share
The knowledge and insights hidden in tombs
We're all Music Box Dancers all alone in our rooms
We sit on our shelves where objects reside
We don't allow the music to get right inside

Music Box Dancer's now completely alone
No winder or no listener, because nobody's home
How long before someone will re-wind the spring?
The room will now be witness; and silence can't sing"
649,The Devil Went Down to Georgia,The Charlie Daniels Band,The Charlie,The Devil Went Down to Georgia The Charlie,"The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""

""I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think I'm better than you.""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

[Demonic violin piece]

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

[Non-demonic violin piece]

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.""
And he played:

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no"

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Oohoohooh oooh

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Unlucky in love, least that's what they say
He lost his head and he gambled his heart away
He still keeps searching though there's nothing left
Staked his heart and lost, now he has to pay the cost

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

""It's okay"", he smiles and says
Though this loneliness is driving him crazy
He don't show what goes on in his head
But if you watch very close you'll see it all

Sit down, take a look at yourself
Don't you want to be somebody
Someday somebody's gonna see inside
You have to face up, you can't run and hide

Have you heard about the lonesome loser
Beaten by the queen of hearts every time
Have you heard about the lonesome loser
He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Have you heard about the lonesome loser

And it's getting so much better
You came home without a word
Though everybody said
You'll soon forget her

They couldn't see and
They just didn't understand
And looking in the mirror
There were fools at either hand

Can you understand (yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right
(I know it is) will you be the same

How many days had I been
Waiting there to tell you
I really can't believe
We're walking out into the world tonight

We'll do it all again
Until the break of light
And the feeling in your heart
Will soon be shining in your eyes

Well I'm not the kind to live in the past
The years run too short and the days too fast
The things you lean on, are the things that don't last
Well it's just now and then, my line gets cast into these
Time passages
There's something back here that you left behind
Oh, time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

Well the picture is changing, now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something, and the music's loud
A girl comes towards you, you once used to know

Just try to recall when we were as one

And I'm so proud
When we walk down the street
And I know it's crazy to worry like I do
But I get this feeling that I'm losing you

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way

Suspicions
I can't help it
You're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

When I go out to a party with you
You always turn every head in the room
And I just know what's on every man's mind
I try to fight it
But it gets me sometimes

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way

Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it
You're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

Ooh, suspicions

When I'm with you
I feel so satisfied
The way you touch me when you lay by my side

And that look
You get in your eyes when we love
It makes me hate myself for what I'm thinking of

I get these suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way

Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it
You're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

Suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way

Ooh, suspicions
I can't help it you're just so good looking
I'm afraid somebody's gonna steal you away from me

Ooh, suspicions
Even though I know that you love me, baby
And I really shouldn't feel this way"

There are words for the magic of a sunrise
Only none of them will do
For you, you take my breath away

Bet you're sittin' drinkin' coffee, yawnin' sleepily

Just to let you know
I'm gonna be home soon
I'm kinda awkward and afraid
Time has changed your point of view

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways

How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home

Listen darlin', now I'm heading for the west
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess

Yes, I'm worried honey
Guess that's natural though
It's like I'm waiting for a welcome sign
Like a hobo in the snow

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways

How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home

And just like the first time
We're just strangers again
I might have grown out of style
In the place I've been

And just like the first time
I'll be shakin' inside
When I walk in the door
There'll be no place to hide

How you gonna see me now?
Please don't see me ugly babe
'Cause I know I let you down
In oh so many ways

How you gonna see me now?
Since we've been on our own
Are you gonna love the man
When the man gets home"

I need you to soothe my head
Turn my blue heart to red

I got a bad case of loving you
No pill's gonna cure my ill
I've got a bad case of lovin' you

A pretty face don't make no pretty heart
I learned that, buddy, from the start
You think I'm cute, a little bit shy
Mama, I ain't that kind of guy

Doctor, doctor, gimme the news
I got a bad case of loving you
No pill's gonna cure my ill
I got a bad case of lovin' you

Whoa

I know you like it, you like it on top
Tell me, mama, are you gonna stop?

You had me down twenty-one to zip
Smile of Judas on your lip
Shake my fist, knock on wood
I've got it bad and I got it good

Until the flames of love enfold you

Laying beside you, lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door

Come with me
Somewhere in the night we will know
Everything lovers can know
You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again
Loving so warm, moving so right
Closing our eyes and feeling alive
We'll just go on burning bright
Somewhere in the night

You'll sleep when the morning comes
And I'll lie and watch you sleeping
And you'll smile when you dream about the night
Like it's a secret you've been keeping

Laying beside you lost in the feeling
So glad you opened my door

You're my song
Music too magic to end
I'll play you over and over again

And no one is hearin a word
Just tryin to escape the frustrations
Till a song in the night can be heard

Put on your dancin shoes
Throw out those one-night blues
Heres one to love and to chance
For a spin on that wheel of romance

Too slow to unriddle your problems
Too lonely for someone to care
Long, lonely silence keeps haunting
Till the song in the night finds you there

Put on your dancin shoes
Throw out those one-night blues
