1771,Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through,Meat Loaf,Meat Loaf,Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through Meat Loaf,"You can't run away forever
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start
You want to shut out the night
You want to shut down the sun
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart

Think of how we'd lay down together
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs

I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it

I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid
And you're completely amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do

Keep on believing
And you'll discover baby

There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through

The beat is yours forever
The beat is always true
And when you really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through for you

Once upon a time was a backbeat
Once upon a time all the chords came to life
And the angels had guitars even before they had wings
If you hold onto a chorus you can get through the night

I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
And you've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it

I treasure you love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
You're never alone cause you can put on the phones
And let the drummer tell your heart what to do

Keep on believing
And you'll discover baby

There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through

The beat is yours forever
The beat is always true
And when you really, really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through for you

(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)
(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)
(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)
(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)
(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)
(The beat is yours forever
That's when rock and roll dreams come through)"
1772,Amazing,Aerosmith,Aerosmith,Amazing Aerosmith,"[Verse One]
I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die

[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you, finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight

[Bridge]
That one last shot's a permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings

[Verse Two]

You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive

[Chorus]

Desperate hearts, desperate hearts....

[Solo]

[Outro: Spoken]
""So from all of us at Aerosmith to all of you out there, wherever you are, remember: the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night."""

Call me raider, call me wrong
Call me insane, call me Mr. Vain
Call me what you like
As long as you call me, time and again
Feel the presence of the aura
Of the man, none to compare
Loveless dying
For a chance just to touch a hand
Or a moment to share
Can't deny the urge, that makes them
Want to lose themselves to the debonair one
Hold me back, the simple fact is
That I'm all that, and I'm always near
One sexy can't perplex me
Now you know who's raw
As if you didn't know before
I know what I want, and I want it now
I want you, and then I want a little more

That makes you want to grab, and hold, and squeeze real tight
Who's gonna be the one to save you from yourself
When you wanna take a bite
Please, oh baby, please
You beg, you want to stay, you got to get some
Caught up in the charm, that I laid on thick
And now there's nowhere to run
Just another fish to pick the worm on the hook of my line
Yeah, I keep many
Females longing for a chance to win my heart

1777,Mary Jane's Last Dance,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,Tom Petty,Mary Jane's Last Dance Tom Petty,"She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights

Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on.""

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

Oh, my, my, Oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come cause I can't stay long

[Hook]
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
Nightfall will be comin' soon

Oh, my, my, Oh, hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road

Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again"

In this crazy world
You're everything I've tried to find
Your love is a pearl
You're my Mona Lisa
You're my rainbow skies
And my only prayer is that you realize...
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

The world will turn
And the seasons will change
And all the lessons we will learn
Will be beautiful and strange
We'll have our fill of tears
Our share of sighs
My only prayer is that you realize...
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

You will always be
Beautiful in my eyes
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes

And there are lines upon my face
From a lifetime of smiles
When the time comes to embrace
For one long last while
We can laugh about
How time really flies
We won't say good-bye
Cause' true love never dies...
You'll always be beautiful in my eyes

You will always be (You will always be)
Beautiful in my eyes (Beautiful in my eyes)
And the passing years will show
That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes

That you will always grow
Ever more beautiful in my eyes"

1781,Flava in Ya Ear,Craig Mack,Craig Mack,Flava in Ya Ear Craig Mack,"[Produced by Easy Mo Bee]

[Intro]
Yo, Mack, I don't even understand
How they didn't understand you in that Mary joint
(Yeah, I know, man)
Kick that old robotic, futuristic, George Jetson, crazy joint!

[Verse 1]
Just like Uniblab, robotic kicking flab
My flavor bidder badder chitter-chatter
Madder than the Mad Hatter
I bet you my shit come out phatter
I got the data to turn your body into anti-matter
And just like a piece of Sizzlean
You'll fit inside my stomach with the eggs and grits between
The king is what I mean, I mean
My man get a cup and put some change inside your hand
Now, hold up, let's make this official
Everybody let's agree that MC's need a tissue
The funk's my only issue
I bet your mama miss you
And I bet the Mack take off, like an MX missile
No more of your whinin' on the charts climbin'
As I make the funk kicking out more harder than a diamond
And if you didn't know who's rhymin'
I guess I'm gonna say ""Craig Mack"" with perfect timin'
You won't be around next year
My rap's too severe, kickin' mad flava in ya ear

[Chorus]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 2]
Craig Mack, one thousand degrees
You'll be on your knees, and you'll be burning, begging please
Brother, freeze! This man's undisputed
In deep-rooted funk smoke that leaves your brains booted
This bad MC with stamina like Bruce Jenner
The winner, tasting MC's for dinner
You're crazy like that glue, to think that you could outdo my one-two that's sick like the flu
Boy, I flip, boy, all the time
‘Cause, boy, the rhyme you kickin' ain't worth a dime
Seems like there's no competition in this rap world expedition
You come around, I'll knock you out position
No flav could ever dig a grave, for the Mack
The power pack in black, making cement crack
And here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Chorus]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear

[Verse 3]
Ha! The Mack's dope with more hope than your Pope
But for MC's more knots than rope
I'd like to break it down, down-breaking forsaken
Lords of MC's shakin' with this track that my man's makin'
MC's will run like a bomb threat
I bet, or better yet, make you sweat
Getting hotter than the sun get
Craig Mack is the flav that rocks from here to Tibet
I break all rules with my action
That the Mack sends to MC's, stop relaxin'
This brand new Sherrif that's in town
Getting down, leaving bodies buried in the ground
I set up rhymes for a decoy
Now I'm a Bad Boy, watch the MC's I destroy, and…

[Chorus]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kickin' new flava in ya ear
Mack's the brand new flava in ya ear"

U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black man from (You got to let him know)
Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

[Verse 1]
Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you calling a bitch?""

U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity (You gotta let him know)

U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black man from (You got to let him know)
Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

[Verse 2]
I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All I knew was you, you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you wait and see (Who you calling a bitch?)

Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

[Verse 3]
What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a ""gangsta bitch""
Now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wildin', acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this worth getting your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
(Barking with no bite!)
She got to wear that for life
(Who you calling a bitch?)

[Hook]
U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity (You gotta let him know)

1783,Prayer for the Dying,Seal,Seal,Prayer for the Dying Seal,"[Verse 1]
Fearless people
Careless needle
Harsh words spoken
And lives are broken
Forceful aging
Help me, I'm fading
Heaven's waiting
It's time to move on

[Hook 1]
Crossing that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

[Verse 2]
Just say, ""Die,"" and that would be pessimistic
In your mind, we can walk across water
Please don't cry, it's just a prayer for the dying
I just don't know what's got into me

[Hook 1]
Crossing that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

[Hook 2]
There is a light through that window
Hold on say yes, while people say no
Life carries on
It goes on

[Hook 1]
Crossing that bridge
With lessons I've learned
Playing with fire
And not getting burned
I may not know what you're going through
But time is the space between me and you
Life carries on
It goes on

[Hook 2]
There is a light through that window
Hold on say yes, while people say no
Life carries on
It goes on
It goes on
Goes, goes
Life carries on

[Outro]
When nothing else matters
When nothing else matters
I just don't know what's got into me
It's just a prayer for the dying
For the dying"

Things haven't been the same
Since you came into my life
You found a way to touch my soul
And I'm never, ever, ever going to let it go

[Pre-Chorus]
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

[Chorus]
Something's coming over, mmm mmm
Something's coming over, mmm mmm
Something's coming over me
My baby's got a secret

[Verse 2]
You gave me back the paradise
That I thought I lost for good
You helped me find the reasons why
It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever loving anybody else

[Pre-Chorus]
Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

1786,Everyday,Phil Collins,Phil Collins,Everyday Phil Collins,"[Verse 1]
I got lost, couldn't find my way
And i guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But i'm here and here i will stay
So everyday i cry
Yes everyday i fall
Do you ever wonder why, why i love everything about you

[Chorus]
But everyday i say i'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

[Verse 2]
It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still i love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day
So everyday goes by
And everyday i fall
It makes me wonder why
My life's worth nothing without you

[Chorus]
But everyday i say i'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

[Bridge]
You'll never know, no, no, no ,no ,no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no ,no ,no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

[Verse 3]
The book closes and we try to forget
But i know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange
And so the light fades away
Try, try, try as i may
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday i say i'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

Johnny's daddy was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 1]
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 2]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 2]
Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 3]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, ""It's time to go""
Doctor says, ""The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast"" and
Johnny hit his knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And then he prayed:

[Chorus 3]
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl

Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Verse 1]
I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kind of digging me
But every time you see me
Word is born, you be ignoring me

I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me

But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
And catch you the next day

When I'm in focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you

I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low pro-file type

I always thought you
Was a rah-rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama

What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one

I want to know cause if I don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me

[Hook]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Verse 2]
I'm steady, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from

The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
And I want some

So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A brother to get got?
I'm not your man

But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me

I gotta hear it from your girls, Uptown
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the Boogie Down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me

I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet

Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking

""Hey, yo, hey, yo....""
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
""Hey, yo, hey, yo....""
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party

[Verse 3]
I never stumble cause I'm humble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped

But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away

Emotional trips
Get a grip
Because I'm losing it
Ideas were clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it

I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already

But I'mma put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide

Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Hook until fade]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love"

Oh, what a night
Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night
Oh, what a night
You know, I didn't even know her name
But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

[Chorus - Frankie Valli]
Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I
As I recall, it ended much too soon

[Verse 2 - Gerry Polci]
Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

And I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinning my head around and taking my body under
Oh, what a night

Oh, I
I got a funny feeling when she walked in the room
And I
As I recall, it ended much too soon

Seemed so wrong but now it seems so right
What a lady, what a night

Spinning my head around and taking my body under

I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

All my friends call me Bear Claw
The Village Chieftain is my paw-paw
He gets his orders from my maw-maw
She makes him walk the line

You can find me in my wigwam
I'll be beating on my tom-tom
Pull out the pipe and smoke you some
Hey and pass it around

'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

I ain't lookin' for trouble
We can ride my pony double
Make your little heart bubble
Lord, Like a glass of wine

I remember the medicine man
He caught Running Water in my hands
Drug me around by my headband
Said I wasn't her kind

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an Indian outlaw
Half Cherokee and Choctaw
My baby she's a Chippewa
She's one of a kind

[Verse 3]
I can kill a deer or buffalo
With just my arrow and my hickory bow
From a hundred yards don't you know
I do it all the time

They all gather 'round my teepee
Late at night tryin' to catch a peek at me
In nothin' but my buffalo briefs
I got them standin' in line

This romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

[Verse 2]
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time

[Chorus]
Yeah, I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

[Bridge]
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always"

That you ache for something new
And some other woman is looking like somethin'
That might be good for you

I'm trying to explain
I've been here before and I'm locking the door

That holds you down today

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 1]
I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little niggarole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go tagging along
Nagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggas singing the blues
That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin ""Yo momma black; his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sporting BK's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blown up)
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminiscing and telling
'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eating pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad cause when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishing all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
And everybody say (I remember way back when)
What? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)

[Verse 3]
Well, it's the niggarole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holding
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbing
You steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but
Sometimes I still sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Sitting here waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns to cold cold sweat
Thinking about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now
I've gotta know, do you feel the same
Do you just light up at the mention of my name

[Chorus]
Don't worry baby
Ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
If your whole world is shakin'
And you feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneaking up on your blind side
And you might as well try and stop the rain
Or stand in the track of a runaway train
You just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be

Where do they get off telling you
That I am not the least bit into you
Just tell me how the hell
They can tell you they know what's in my heart

What do they get from telling you
That I don't give a damn about
Just tell me why the hell
Someone wants to tear your heart apart

[Hook:]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why do them people like to tell you lies
I know, I know, I know, I know
I love you more than words could ever show

I can't, I can't, I can't
I can't explain
Why do some people have to be that way
I can't take much more
I can't ignore
I have to let you know what's in my heart

[Chorus:]
If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl
I'm saying I do
You can know that from this moment
You were always in my heart

If I never ever say that I love you
Just remember, girl
I'm saying I do love you
You'll be always in my heart

They're not the ones who'll be there for you
When you need someone to turn to
They won't be anywhere
Be anywhere when things start falling down

They're only in it to confuse you
So they can turn around and use you
But it can't happen
It won't happen, girl
As long as I'm around

Oh, why
Why, why, why
Yeah
Why did you have to listen to the lies?

Oh, please, baby, please
I wish you could believe in me
Right now, right now
If only you could know

We fell in love
And who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
And now they wonder
Why we didn't last

We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder
Love came to an end

[Chorus]
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings, yeah
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
Who don't know...

[Verse 2]
We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared
They didn't help
Makes me wonder
Should we blame ourselves?

So here we are
Broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves?
When everybody says to let it end, baby
Well, it makes me wonder
We can't let them win

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion

If we'd only just try, we could make it by
And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we shoulda done
We'd both be here still making love
I wanna know that, that we can go back
Back to the times when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love

[Chorus]
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion

The kind of girl you that you could be down for
Cuz when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know
Then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact than I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is the time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you call baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to call you up
And let you know everything will be all right

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies are down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't lookin'

They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at her son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby it's good to me""
One day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all, don't hear me

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear and blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast"

That I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Verse 2]
So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Spoken]
Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

[Bridge]
Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

[Chorus] [x2]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on
Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Wanna build a new life
Just you and me
Gonna make you my wife
Raise a family"

Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older

Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part
Where you're breaking my heart (breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown

You deserve an award for the role that you played (role that you played)

How was I to know you'd break

This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel all right
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills y'all

If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway

You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash

Now, now they can see the tears in our eyes

I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek, so shall we find
And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
'Bout a great many things
But I've been there, I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing, ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch
Hey baby, let's keep in touch""

But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
And I got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full

Oh, I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well, all right, okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Oh, you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?"

And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time

Yeah, I will love you baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always

I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and

And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always"

Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming around
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always you wanted to be
Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wonderous as you
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better; there's nothing that I just wouldn't do
Turn around bright eyes

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

But now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
A total eclipse of the heart
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark

Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

That you are not alone

But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone
Not alone oh
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone

I was thinking about you last night
Mm you actin' like you can't call me no more cause you busy n all that, but you trying to tell me it wasn't good?

*beep*

And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you, ""why the fuck Big don't want me?""

*beep*

Yo Big this is Quita, Kenya told me she saw you and Shanie at the mall and I know you ain't fucking her
You fucked with me last night, that's my best friend and we don't get down like that!

I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour

When you get in give me a fucking call alright?

[Verse 1: Biggie]
When it comes to sex, I’m similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it’s stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I’m not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I’ll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don’t get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn’t matter: skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a .44
For niggas getting mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G
You see, all I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed:
I’m guaranteed to fuck her ’til her nose bleed
Even if your new man’s a certified mack
You’ll get that H-Town in ya: you want that old thing back

[Hook: Faith Evans & Biggie]
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn’t know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

[Verse 2]
Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me
She mad because what we had didn’t last
I’m glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past: let’s dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with benjamins
Another honey’s in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
‘Cause y’all don’t know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex -- and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don’t chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I’m caressing 'em I’m undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who’s the best in New York
Fulfilling fantasies without that nigga Mr. Roarke or Tattoo
I got you wrapped around my dick and when I nut I got to split
Backshots is my position, I got you wishing for an intermission
Fuck the kissin'
Lick you down to your belly button, I ain’t frontin’
They don’t call me big for nuttin’ all of a sudden

Are you strong enough to be my man, my man?
Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man?

[Chorus]
Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave, don't leave

[Verse 2]
I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
Just try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man, my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough to be my man?
Are you strong enough? My man..
When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Would you be man enough to be my man?

[Chorus]
Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave, don't leave"
1831,Colors of the Wind,Vanessa Williams,Vanessa Williams,Colors of the Wind Vanessa Williams,"[Verse 1]
You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know ev'ry rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

[Chorus]
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

[Verse 2]
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth

The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we're all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

[Chorus]
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you there he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

[Bridge]
How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down
Then you'll never know

[Chorus]
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind

You can own the earth and still
All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all colors of the wind"

I only know I live and breathe for your love

When I needed you, you're there for me
Baby, the love from you is what got me through
It's because of you I was able to
Give my heart again, you give me

I thought my life was over and
I didn't want to face nor even see another day
Suddenly from nowhere, baby you appeared
You dried my tears, you cared for me
Baby your love for me, truly rescued me
It's because of you, I was able to
Fall in love again, you give me

Now that you're by my side
Everything is all right

Give my heart again, you give me

You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I'll only pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

Well there's nothing I can do

Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky

I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the oath that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare

You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart

So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul

If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down

Uncover me
Come my restoration
Wash my body clean
I've been walking
Along a crooked path
Where the walls have fallen
And broken me in half

I'm telling you
I will not rest till I lay down my head
I'm gonna go
In the house of stone and light
I shall not cry for the blind man I leave behind
When I got
In the house of stone and light
In the house of stone and light

Holy lady
Show me my soul
Tell me of that place
Where I must surely go
Old man waiting
At the gates for me
Give me the wisdom
Give me the key

I'm telling you
I will not rest till I lay down my head
In the house of stone and light
I make my way O gonna be such a beautiful day
In the house of stone and light
In the house of stone and light

Let me in beneath my skin
In the house of stone and light

It's been too long
My spirit's been at war
Havasupai Shaman
Let me be reborn

All I will embrace the sun upon my face
Come the day I awake the child inside
In the house of stone and light
And when I go I will op-op-open my eyes
In the house of stone and light
I will see you
In the house of stone and light

I'm looking in beneath my skin

1836,I Got 5 on It,Luniz,Luniz,I Got 5 on It Luniz,"[Produced by Tone Capone]

[Intro]
People in Oakland, Oakland
See I'm ridin' higher and higher (woah-ohh)
Kinda broke, so y'all know all I got's five, I got five

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it across the table, like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest, like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to getting another stogie
Fools all kick in, like Shinobi
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many hands to be poppin' up, let my friend hit it
Unless you pull out the fat-crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
‘Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dum-da-dum-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land, like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bong back
Suck up the dank like a Slurpee; the serious bomb
Will make a niggy go delirious, like Eddie Murphy
I got more growing pains than Maggie
‘Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

[Hook]
I got five on it; grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, can not go back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Numskull]
I take sacks to the face whenever I can
Don't need no crutch, I'm so keyed up
'Til the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the joint
Stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P-O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me

[Hook]
I got five on it; grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, can not go back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 3: Numskull]
Hey, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I face, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk

[Verse 4: Yukmouth]
Been smoked, Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down
Up in the O-A-K, the Town
Homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‘cause where I be we need half, like Umfufu

[Hook]
I got five on it; grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, can not go back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack"

1839,As I Lay Me Down,Sophie B. Hawkins,Sophie B.,As I Lay Me Down Sophie B.,"[Verse 1:]
It felt like springtime
On this February morning
In a courtyard
Birds were singing your praise

I'm still recalling things you said
To make me feel all right
I carry them with me today now

[Chorus:]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear

Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy

[Verse 2:]
I wonder why I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Til you call my name

And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I went to meet you barefoot
Barely breathing

[Repeat Chorus:]

Oh, darling

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
It`s not too near for me
Like a flower
I need the rain

Thought it`s not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

Mmm, the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again

When the sun comes out
Oh, the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out"

He might be doing you
But he's thinking about me
So baby, think about another lover
And go find another brother
I know he's my man
He's all in my hands
It feels good when he calls my name
Don't you wish you had the same?
Feeling disgust working your stuff
Until he thinks about mine
Now he's feeling real high
You ask why 'cause he's mine

Tell you something
That just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man
Who don't love you
I wouldn't waste my time
Telling something wrong
You've been with him one night
And now he's coming home

[Chorus:]
He's mine
You may have had him once
But I got him all the time
(You can't sleep at night)
He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time

He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time
(I got him all the time)

[Verse 2:]
Went out on a date
Wasn't out too late
Took you to a room
And you gave it up too soon
Played you like a trick
'Cuz you let him hit
Now he's coming home to a lover
That is strong

I got all his love, baby, don't try to take it
You wanted a piece, you were mistaken
'Cuz he belongs to me
Baby, can't you see?
I tell you something that just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man
Who don't love you

I wouldn't waste my time
Telling you something wrong
You've been with him one night
And now he's coming home

For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nuttin make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my booty away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin in the effin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk wit me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you
I got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister, you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses
Valentine cards and birthday wishes? Please
Be on another level of planning, of understanding
The bond between man and woman, and child
The highest elevation, cuz we above
All that romance crap, just show your love

1844,I'm the Only One,Melissa Etheridge,Melissa Etheridge,I'm the Only One Melissa Etheridge,"[Verse 1]
Please, baby, can't you see
My mind's a burnin' hell
I got razors a-rippin' and tearin' and strippin'
My heart apart as well
Tonight you told me
That you ache for something new
And some other woman is looking like somethin'
That might be good for you

[Chorus]
Go on, and hold her 'til the screaming is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you
Nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

[Verse 2]
Please baby can't you see
I'm trying to explain
I've been here before and I'm locking the door
And I'm not going back again
Her eyes and arms and skin won't make
It go away
You'll wake up tomorrow and wrestle the sorrow
That holds you down today

[Chorus]
Go on, and hold her 'til the screaming is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you
Nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

[Chorus]
Go on, and hold her 'til the screaming is gone
Go on, believe her when she tells you
Nothing's wrong
But I'm the only one
Who'll walk across the fire for you
And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

And I'm the only one
Who'll drown in my desire for you
It's only fear that makes you run
The demons that you're hiding from
When all your promises are gone
I'm the only one

I'm the only one
I'm the only one
Ain't nobody else is gonna love you"

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]

Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player

Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line
""What's your name? What's your sign?""
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo?
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me

Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player

Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever

However, living better now, Coogi sweater now

1848,Sukiyaki,4 P.M.,4 P.M.,Sukiyaki 4 P.M.,"It's all because of you, I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day

And I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely

Untouchable memories, seem to keep haunting me
Of a love so true
That it once turned all my gray skies blue

But you disappeared
Now my eyes are filled with tears
And I'm wishing you were here with me

Soaked with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, I just don't know what to do

If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine and once again
You'd be mine all mine

But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me

Girl, I don't know what I did
To make you leave me but what I do know
Is that since you've been gone
There's such an emptiness inside
I'm wishing you'd come back to me

If only you were here
You'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine and once again
You'd be mine all mine

But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me

Oh, baby, you took your love away from me"

The kind of girl you that you could be down for
Cuz when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know
Then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

I wanna be down
I wanna be down with you
No matter what time of day or night it's true
I wanna be down

I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact than I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is the time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you call baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to call you up
And let you know everything will be all right

1851,Dear Mama,2Pac,2Pac,Dear Mama 2Pac,"[Verse 1: 2Pac]
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Hook: Reggie Green & ""Sweet Franklin"" + 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Hook: Reggie Green & ""Sweet Franklin"" + 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

[Hook: Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin + 2Pac]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)

In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick

Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

Won't you teach me how to love and learn
There'll be nothing left for me to yearn
Think of me and burn, and let me hold your hand

I don't wanna face the world in tears
Please think again, I'm on my knees
Sing that song to me, no reason to repent
I know you wanna say it"
1855,Roll to Me,Del Amitri,Del Amitri,Roll to Me Del Amitri,"Look around your world pretty baby
Is it everything you hoped it'd be
The wrong guy, the wrong situation
The right time to roll to me
Roll to me

Look into your heart pretty baby
Is it aching with some nameless need
Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Right then, roll to me

And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through
Guess who will be there?

So don't try to deny it pretty baby
You've been down so long you can hardly see
When the engine's stalled and it won't stop raining
It's the right time to roll to me
Roll to me, Roll to me

So Look around your world pretty baby
Is it everything you hoped it'd be
The wrong guy, the wrong situation
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me
The right time to roll to me

Hello?

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme a way to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls and, me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle and I been in the hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame when you living in a city
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcometh by the thoughts of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car, I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With the hood rats you can hold tight
But really though, I'm a Figaro
When I'm in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well then I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""
'Cause it's hard to survive when you're living
In a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""My, my, my""

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way 'cause every day would be a Friday
And you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names, Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck
Then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me

Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later

[Chorus]
But love
I believe in love

[Verse 2]
I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease

Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone

[Chorus]
But love
I believe in love

Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here

Without love I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you
And I wouldn't believe in me

Without love
I believe in love

1860,Carnival,Natalie Merchant,Natalie Merchant,Carnival Natalie Merchant,"[Verse 1:]
I've walked these streets
A virtual stage
It seemed to me
Make up on their faces
Actors took their places next to me

I've walked these streets
In a carnival
Of sights to see
All the cheap thrill seekers
The vendors & the dealers
They crowded around me

[Chorus:]
Have I been blind?
Have I been lost?
Inside myself and my own mind?
Hypnotized
Mesmerized
By what my eyes have seen?

[Verse 2:]
I've walked these streets
In a spectacle of wealth & poverty
In the diamond market
The scarlet welcome carpet
That they just rolled out for me

I've walked these streets
In the mad house asylum
They can be
Where a wild eyed misfit prophet
On a traffic island stopped
And he raved of saving me

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Have I been wrong?
Have I been wise?
To shut my eyes and play along?

Hypnotized
Paralyzed
By what my eyes have found
By what my eyes have seen
What they have seen?

[Chorus:]
Have I been blind?
Have I been lost?
Have I been wrong?
Have I been wise?
Have I been strong?

Have I been
Hypnotized
Mesmerized
By what my eyes have found
In that great street carnival
In that carnival"

Let me run with you tonight
I'll take you on a moonlight ride
There's someone I used to see
But she don't give a damn for me

But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

People come, people go
Some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between
A memory and a dream

But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

My old man was born to rock
He's still tryin' to beat the clock
Think of me what you will
I've got a little space to fill

But let me get to the point, let's roll another joint
And turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels to be me

You don't know how it feels
You don't know how it feels
No, you don't know how it feels to be me"
1862,Back for Good,Take That,Take That,Back for Good Take That,"[Verse 1]
I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

[Chorus]
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

[Verse 2]
Unaware but underlined I figured out this story (No, no)
It wasn't good (No, no)
But in the corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be
In the twist of separation you excelled at being free
Can't you find
(Can't you find)
A little room inside for me

[Chorus]
Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
See I want you back for good
Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(Want you back, want you back, want you back for good)
I want you back for good

And we'll be together, this time is forever
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did I didn't mean it

Whenever I'm wrong just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood

""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Bridge]
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

[Chorus Variation]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard"

I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are ""know-it-alls"" and i played that fool for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

[Chorus 1]
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

[Verse 2]
Baby, i thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving

[Chorus 1]
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

[Chorus 2]
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't a love song

[Pre-Chorus]
I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

You found a way to touch my soul

How it could be

Something's coming over me
My baby's got a secret

It took me by surprise that you understood
You knew all along
What I never wanted to say
Until I learned to love myself
I was never ever loving anybody else

Happiness lies in your own hand
It took me much too long to understand
How it could be
Until you shared your secret with me

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(Niggas) Grab your dick if you love hip-hop
(Bitches) Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Gotcha, open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday""

[Verse 1: Lil' Cease]
Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit?
What are you a idiot?
Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's
Got mad guns up in the cabin
Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin and dabbin shit
I make it happen, you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire, from the Honda Passport
Or the M.P., what if you see, then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
G'wan grit ya teeth, g'wan bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray, my killings be the most beautiful
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique thick like Luke dancers
Niggas grab your gats, bitches take a glance at
The little one, pullin over in the Land Rover
Playin Big Willie style with a chaffeur, yaknahmean?
Stack the green, read all between the lines
A nigga act up, makes the bastard hard to find

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(Niggas) Grab your dick if you love hip-hop
(Bitches) Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Gotcha, open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday""

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
(How ya livin Biggie Smalls?) I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals
Smokin skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it
Shit get drastic, I'm buryin ya bastards
Big Poppa never softenin
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offerin
Leave the fucker coughin up blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covet the wife, Kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches
She whippin my ride, countin my one's, thinkin I'm richest
Just the way players play, all day everyday
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbin niggas since
Run and them was singin ""Here We Go""
Snatchin ropes at the Roxy, homeboy, you didn't know?
My flow, detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self, I have son ridin shotgun
My mind's my nine, my pen's my Mac-10
My target, all you wack niggas who started rappin
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo, niggas know the half
Caviar for breakfast, champagne bubble baths
Runnin up in pretty bitches constantly
The Smalls bitch, who the fuck it was supposed to be?

[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G.]
(Niggas) Grab your dick if you love hip-hop
(Bitches) Rub your titties if you love Big Poppa
Gotcha, open off the words I say because
""This type of shit it happens everyday""

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
I used to pack Macs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's, watch my niggas backs
Nines in the stores, Glocks in the bags
Maxin mini-markets, gettin money with the Arabs
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical
Bitches squeeze your tits, niggas grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals, excluse subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the rilli with my peeps all day
325's roll by with the windows down halfway
D-K-N-Y, oh my, I'm jiggy
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin nigga Biggie
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme
Cause they all in line screamin one more time
Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches rub-a-dub in the back of the club, straight up"

You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin' dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written and kitten hittin' with mittens
I'm missin', wishin', man, listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded, I said it, word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy and alleys
Are full of Phillies and Rallys
Suckers get silly as Sally
Then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

[Hook: Treach]
So here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

[Verse 2: Treach]
Never mixin' with trickin' brothers bitchin'
Over fixing's that ain't fittin' to be hittin'
For nothin' splittin' things that's bitten
And gettin' written off
You're like a fatter half bladder, boy, you pissin' me off
Before you even started, so what
So long, see you fly by, my try
How else could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye?

[Hook]
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

[Verse 3: Treach]
The flow pro poetical with skills only a vet'll know
Better know where's the wetter flow
That's on point like decimals
Manhandlin' new crews
Partyin' with the Zoo Crew
Lookin' for the pink in poo boo's
I thought you knew too, stone style is of stamina
Jammin' to while we plannin' to jam
We bust, plus we're the party
Amateur damager managin'
Damagin' mics, men and even mannequins
You're a fan again
Now I wanna know, who's the man again?
Naughty's back like vertebrates
Word to hey-a-ho, the way I show you pray I flow
Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time
To slang, bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang

[Hook: Treach]
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

[Verse 4: Treach]
Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
Then beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully, chase bass lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up, get up
Get up your with up, souped up
Put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups
Flip up, watch us rip up
Shake shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like you're with us
If not zip up, you lip up, whip up
Hits with ransoms, foul styles get and ones
We come back 'cause we heard
Hip Hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and fo' ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flow-ers
Revin'(?) these since the seventies, find me
So we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops, the Naughty's troop in sections of forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty, I'm Naughty

[Hook]
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

That everything in love would be right

I was saying to love, ""Goodbye""

I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me calling out
Calling for your warm affection after all this time

Bridge:
You can't deny what I'm feeling is real
And I stood around, stood by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
And you turned and walked away

I remember (I remember) the way you used (you used to love me) to love me
(Baby)
I remember the days you used to love me
(oh remember)

Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me
Give it to me
What a feeling it's for real

(I remember)
I remember (I remember) the way you used (Baby you use to love me) to love me
I remember the days you used to love me

You didn't hear me calling out
And that's not what love's about
I remember you used to love me
You used to love me every day (every day, every day)
Now your love has gone away
I remember I remember


(Baby, I remember)
I remember (I remember) the way you used (used to love me every day) to love me
I remember (I remember, I remember) the days you used to love me


Oh baby you used to walk holding my hand (I remember the way you used to love me)
Cuz you used to be my man
I remember, all the way (I remember the way you used to love me)
Didn't hear me calling out
And that's not what love's about
I remember oh oh oh, baby you used to love me (I remember the way you used to love me)
Baby you used to love me
I remember the way you used to love me (I said I remember...)"

I wanna chill (chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely sipping on bubbly)

[Verse 1: AZ]
At times I window watch out the Mariott
Zoning on owning co-ops, foreign drop top coupes, and yachts
Guzzling straight shots of scotch
Formulating up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot
Cause it's scorching hot
Making it hard trying to figure who's out to trap me
Pataki, got all kinds of undercovers coming at me
Perhaps he, won't be happy, 'til they snatch me
And place me where half us blacks be, sitting in Coxsackie
But never me, see, my destiny's to be forever free
In ecstacy, on a hill that awaits for me
So plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make living this a must, plus, it's real...

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill (chill) on Sugar Hill

Ayo son, pull the shades down and let's count this money
Put the Grants in the safe, cause we spending the Jackson's
The Washington's go to wifey, you know how we do

[Verse 2: AZ]
No more cutting grams, and wrapping grands up in rubber bands
I'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands
Suburban places got me seeking for oasis
Cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old timers
I want a villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed ta' treat ya'
Laid in the shades of the everglades, finally forever paid
Wearing the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team, Carribean cuisine
I guess being down for so long I'm all in store to see my dreams

[Chorus: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill (chill) on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh he's for real)
He's for real
(It's so lovely sipping on bubbly)

[Verse 3: AZ]
So until I see past the green pasture, me being supreme master
Ain't much more life to fiend after, but another chapter
A new way of life to adapt to, cause these streets'll gas ya'
And have ya' caught up in the rapture
Déjà vu, I could vision my killer crew more hospitable
Consciously aware plus political (political..)
Cause though they claim that every man's created equal
Us as native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through
But once established, we eating lovely, living lavish
Like the House of Versailles, Paris, I gotta have this
It's so plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough, to make living this a must, plus, it's real...

I wanna chill (chill) on Sugar Hill

It's so lovely sipping on bubbly

Hidden behind the window and the door
Searching for signs of life

Well, maybe I'm just too sure
Or maybe I'm just too frightened by the sound of it
Pieces of note fall down, but the letter said

[Chorus:]
Aha, it was good
Living with you, aha, it was good
Ah-ah-ah-ah-aha it was good
Living with you, aha, it was good
Ah-ah-ah, good good good

Sitting around the house
Watching the sun trace the shadow on the floor
Searching for signs of life
But there's nobody home
Well, maybe I'll call or I'll write you a letter
Now maybe we'll see on the fourth of July
But I'm not too sure, and I'm not too proud
Well I'm not sure, and I'm not too proud to say

I did my best to keep you satisfied

And used it selfishly
You did not give back your love to me at all

I gave the sun to you

I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine
I gave my world to you
You said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done to make you be so rough

Nothing good is gonna come to you til your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

Girl I was there for you
Someone you could talk to
How could you just keep breaking my heart?
What did I do to you
To make you be so cruel?
I don't understand why you've been so wrong

I tried to be your strength
You said I was too strong
I tried to compromise
So we could get along
I gave my love to you
Despite your evil ways
I guess it's clear to me, there's only one thing left to say

I could ever let go
Your love is much to strong
There are something's that I guess
I'll never know
When you love someone
You got to learn to let them go

When I dream about you
That's when everything's all right
Your in my arms Here next to me, forever
When I dream about you
Girl you never go away
Just close my eyes
Wait for my dreams
Cause I still love, loving you

There are something's that I guess
I'll never know
When you love someone
You got to learn to let them go

When I dream about you
That's when everything's all right
Your in my arms Here next to me, forever
When I dream about you
Girl you never go away
Just close my eyes
Wait for my dreams
Cause I still love, loving you"
1893,Cotton Eye Joe,Rednex,Rednex,Cotton Eye Joe Rednex,"If it hadn't been for Cotton Eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from where did you go
Where did you come from Cotton Eye Joe
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been, if it hadn't been
He came to town like a mid-winter storm
He rode through the fields so handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was having some fun
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been
He brought disaster wherever he went
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent
They all ran away so nobody would know
And left all the men 'cause of Cotton Eye Joe
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been, if it hadn't been
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been"

I was young (BOP)
And didn't have no where to run
I needed to wake up and see (and see)
What's in front of me (na-na-na)
There has to be a better way
Sing it again a better way
To show I'm grateful (hum)
So I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know much you mean to me

[Chorus:]
Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

[Verse 2: Wanya/Mike]
All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing every where I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sho nuff couldn't have survived without you
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me, oh

Hold on
I'm holding on
Baby, just come on, come on, come on

Tumble outta bed
And stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower
And the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets
The traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

[Hook 1]
Working 9 to 5
What a way to make a living
Barely gettin' by
It's all taking
And no giving
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
But the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

They let you dream
Just to watch them shatter
You're just a step
On the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat
With a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day
Your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn
An' it's all gonna roll you away

9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you

And you spend your life
Putting money in his wallet

All dolled up
Singing a song in your pickup truck
You put me on a morning train

Hey, Hey, Brother Ray
What'd you mean by ""what'd I say""
You put me on a morning train

You put me on a morning train
Ain't no need to explain
You put me on a morning train

If it's gonna rain
And I wish that it would
Just go ahead and rain
Get it over for good
If there's really a hole in that big blue sky
Then move it on over and let me by

Constantinople is a mighty long word
Got three more letters than mockingbird
You put me on a morning train

You put me on a morning train
Ain't no need to explain
You put me on a morning train

Be out of the picture and off of the screen
Don't let them say ""we told you so""

I've heard the warning voice
From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

People can change, they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be, that like love I am blind?
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

I don't care what they think about me and

Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise
So won't you keep my heart from breaking
If it's only for a very short time

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie
Thinking 'bout a life of crime
'Cause that's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
So hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts
Knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anything for you

Thinking 'bout a life of crime

And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes the man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eating cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eating cars
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Toe to toe, don't move too slow
Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eating bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all

Through the sewer, don't strain your brain
Paint a train, you'll be singing in the rain
Said don't stop to the punk rock

[Verse 3]
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
Cause the man from Mars won't eat up bars
Where the TV's on and now he's gone
Back up to space where he won't have a hassle
With the human race and you hip hop
And you don't stop, just blast off
Sure shot cause the man from Mars stopped eating cars
And eating bars and now he only eats guitars, get up"

From far away
And found me here

I was playing around
Feeling down
Hitting the beer
You picked me up
From off the floor
And gave me a smile

You said
You're much too young
Your life ain't begun
Let's walk for awhile

And as my head was spinning 'round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, oooh
I want you

Thank you, babe
For being a friend
And shining your light in my life
'Cause, oooh
I need you

As my head was coming round
I gazed into your eyes

I want you

Thanks again for being my friend
And straightening out my life

Beside the victory

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there

Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain? (Why complain)

Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?

Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)

The game is on again (On again)

A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand

I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence

Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another you been messin' around
They say you got a boy friend
You're out late every weekend
They're talkin' about you and it's bringin' me down
But I know the neighborhood
And talk is cheap when the story is good
And the tales grow taller on down the line
But I'm telling you, babe
That I don't think it's true, babe
And even if it is keep this in mind

[Chorus]
You take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it, not for a minute
You're under the gun so you take it on the run

You're thinking up your white lies
You're putting on your bedroom eyes
You say you're coming home but you won't say when
But I can feel it coming
If you leave tonight keep running
And you need never look back again

You take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it, not for a minute
You're under the gun so you take it on the run

You take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby
Then I don't want you around

I've felt so self assured
But suddenly it's all changed
She's a cloud
That hangs above my world
And I find myself wandering in the rain
And now I can't go on

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I need her guiding light
To shine on my darkest days
I was young, and time was on my side
But like a fool I let it slip away
And now those days are gone

And I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

In my life
I've felt so self-assured
But oh how the seasons change
And now I'm not that strong

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this hell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost"

Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place
I kissed the morning goodbye
But down inside you know we never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

[Chorus]
I am a woman In Love and I do anything
(I am a Woman In Love and I do anything)
To get you into my world and hold you within
(To get you into my world and hold you within)
It's a right, I defend
Over and over again
(Over and over again)
What do I do

[Verse 2]
With you eternally mine
In love there is no measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away
You feel my love, I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

[Chorus]
(I am a woman In Love and I do anything)
(To get you into my world and hold you within)
And hold you within
It's a right, I defend

He has the finest penthouse I've ever seen in town
And he's cute
In his mohair suit
And he keeps his pockets full of spending loot
Ooo whee, say you ought to come and see
His dueling scar
And brand new car

Every time he says he loves me
Chills run down my spine
Every time he wants to kiss me
He makes me feel so fine

Tell us about the boy from New York City

Well he can dance
(He can dance, take a chance with a little ro-)
And make romance
(mance baby, cause he's a looker)
That's when I fell in love
With just one glance

He was shy
And so was I
And now I know I'll never, ever say goodbye

I could smile for a while
But when I saw you last night
You held my hand so tight
When you stopped to say 'hello'
And though you wished to me well
You couldn't tell

That I'd been
Crying, over you
Crying, over you

Then you said so long
Left me standing all alone
Alone and crying
Crying
Crying
Crying

It's hard to understand
That the touch of your hand
Can start me crying

I thought that I, was over you
But it's true, so true
I love you even more, than I did before
But, darling, what can I do

While you don't love me
And I'll always be
Crying, over you
Crying, over you

Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying

Will you change your mind?
Will you want me back again or have you found yourself a new lover?

I'll still be free

To those I've tried to please

But now it's my turn
If I don't have all the answers
At least I know
I'll take my share of chances

When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
With no more room for lies
For years I'd seen my life
Through someone else's eyes

And now it's my turn
To try and find my way
And if I should get lost
At least I'll own today

It's my turn
Yes, it's my turn
And there ain't no use in holding of
When nothing stays the same

So I'll let it rain
Cause the rain ain't gonna hurt me
And I'll let you go
Though I know it won't be easy

It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
This time's just for me

Because it's my turn
To turn and say goodbye
I sure would like to know
That you're still on my side

Because it's my turn
It's my turn

It's my turn
To start from number one
Trying to undo
Some damage that's been done

But now it's my turn
To reach and touch the sky
No one's gonna say
At least I didn't try

It's my turn
Yes, it's my turn

[Verse 1: Wale]
Yeah, see, breaking up is hard
To move along, it's even harder
It's over, she got colder, now
Can't locate where her heart is
And I'm just being honest
Since we not even talking
My mind won't let you go
Shit, even consider stalking now
You know I be teasing, though
You know that my ego won't
Thought this was forever love
Guess that was just seasonal
She got back with her old boy
She probably had a reason though
Although thought that we would grow
Guess that wasn't feasible
But we ain't gonna be beefing, no
I miss you at my recent show
I speak to CJ often and sometimes
I just want to speak you up
Yeah, hit you up
Or call you up, or send a text
Your new man got my respect
So if I do call it's just a check
Heard that you alright though
My nigga for life though
It's funny how this life go
We love for a while then a light goes
Took me a while just to write those
Pride, I had a fight so
I'mma stop right there and I know you don't care
But I hope you got that bite, boo, ay

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, tell me about the love of ours
""Contemplate"", I wrote about her
We no longer close or nothing
That's why she ignore my flowers
And my call and my text
Spending her time with him I guess
I regret some shit I did
But darling, is y'all intimate?
Who was better? I know I was
Don't you lie, don't blow my buzz
You ask me who I'm stroking now
I say that the pool is closed
Can we stay broken up?
And all these pages, close them up
I hope we both do learn from this
So my next joint don't got to be so rough
Huh, got to get better with time
Relationships should never rewind
Better leave it all behind
Guess that means you can never be mine
Well, um, there's a but
Without your love it's cold as fuck
Life is a movie we both say ""cut""
But most times darling the sequel sucks"

Lost till the end of time
It's the evening of another day
And the end of mine

Now the starlight which has found me
Lost for a million years
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes
Till it disappears

Could it be that somebody else is
Looking into my mind?

Some other place
Somewhere
Some other time

Some other place
Somewhere
Some other time

Like a mirror held before me
Large as the sky is wide
And the image is reflected
Back to the other side

Could it be that somebody else is
Looking into my mind?

Some other place
Somewhere
Some other time

Some other place
Somewhere

1954,Too Much Time on My Hands,Styx,Styx,Too Much Time on My Hands Styx,"Sitting on this barstool talking like a damn fool
Got the twelve o'clock news blues
And I've given up hope on the afternoon soaps
And a bottle of cold brew
Is it any wonder I'm not crazy?
Is it any wonder I'm sane at all?
Well I'm so tired of losing- I got nothing to do
And all day to do it
I go out cruisin' but I've no place to go
And all night to get there
Is it any wonder I'm not a criminal?
Is it any wonder I'm not in jail?

Is it any wonder I've got too much time on my hands?
It's ticking away with my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands
It's hard to believe such a calamity
I've got too much time on my hands
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me
Too much time on my hands, too much time on my hands
Too much time on my hands

[Guitar Solo]

Well, I'm a jet fuel genius - I can solve the world's problems
Without even trying
I have dozens of friends and the fun never ends
That is, as long as I'm buying
Is it any wonder I'm not the president
(He's not the president)
Is it any wonder I'm null and void?

Is it any wonder I've got too much time on my hands?
It's ticking away at my sanity
I've got too much time on my hands

I've got too much time on my hands
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me
Too much time on my hands, too much time on my hands

Well, then what are we doin' in love
What are we doin' in a mess like this
What are we doin' love
Why were you someone I couldn't resist
What are we doin' in love

We're like paper and matches
Well probably have our share of fights
We're like roses and switches
It's gonna be hard but we've got to try
Oh, what are we doin' in love
What are we doin' in love in a mess like this
What are we doin' in love
What are we gonna tell all our friends
You don't have to like someone to love someone
That rule was made to be broken
But if we have to say goodbye to a life we've gotten used to
What are we doin' in love then

We're like sun up and sun down
People say we're never gonna last
We're like uptown and downtown
You like it slow and I like it fast
So what are we doin' love
What are we doin' love in a mess like this
What are we doin' love
What are we gonna tell all our friends
You don't have to like someone to love someone

Why something good can hurt so bad
Caught on a one-way streets
The taste of bittersweet
Love will survive somehow, some way

One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who will be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now

So many wrongs or rights
Neither could change
Their headstrong ways
And in a lover's rage
They tore another page
The fighting is worth
The love they save

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now
Two hearts born to run
Who'll be the lonely one
Wonder who's crying now

[Verse 3]
Only so many tears you can cry
'Till the heartache is over
And now you can say your love
Will never die

One love feeds the fire
One heart burns desire
Wonder who's crying now

When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you

Dont you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And dont you wonder how you keep on moving?
One more day your way, oh your way

When theres no one left to leave you
Even you dont quite believe you
Thats when nothing can deceive you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you

Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

And that old gray wind is blowing
And theres nothing left worth knowing
And its time you should be going

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because its all on you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it

1969,Master Blaster (Jammin'),Stevie Wonder,Stevie Wonder,Master Blaster (Jammin') Stevie Wonder,"[Verse 1]
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 2]
They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
Because we've only just begun

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on

[Verse 3]
You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
Because we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

[Chorus]
Didn't know you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
I bet nobody ever told you that you
Would be jamming until the break of dawn
You would be jamming and jamming and jamming, jam on"

Just called to say hello
I couldn't sleep at all tonight
And I know it's late
But I couldn't wait

Hello, my friend, hello
Just called to let you know
I think about you ev'ry night
When I'm here alone
And you're there at home, hello

Maybe it's been crazy
And maybe I'm to blame
But I put my heart above my head
We've been through it all
And you loved me just the same
And when you're not there
I just need to hear

Hello, my friend, hello
It's good to need you so
It's good to love you like I do
And to feel this way
When I hear you say, hello

Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Book marking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly

He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

Don't stand so close to me
Please don't stand so close to me"

While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago

I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love

Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago

[Solo]

[Hook]
All those years ago [x2]

[Verse 2]
Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
And all else that we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all, though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago

If you're in the game, then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm - don't take no style
Got a thirst for killing - grab your vile

You put your right hand out - give a firm hand-shake
Talk to me about the one big break
Spread the ear pollution both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side and stroke me, stroke me

Could be a winner boy, you move quite well
You got your number down
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

You put your left foot out - keep it all in place
Work your way right into my case
First you try to bed me - you make my backbone slide
But when you find you bled me - skip on by
Keep on - stroke me, stroke me -

Give me the business all night long
You're so together boy
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

Better listen now...said it ain't no joke
Let your conscience fail ya...just do the stroke
Don'tcha take no chances...keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances...you can't stop, you just"

The fun we use to share
Looking through the memories in my mind
Since I've laughed and cried and thought it over
Now I realize that it's never over only set aside

Oh it's you sweet baby
I will never be free from your embrace, sweet baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you sweet baby
Ever lost and captured by your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side, right by your side

Lyin' here alone I'm dreamin', my mind keeps wanderin'
My thoughts are only you
Wanderin' through the memories in my mind
How could love so real have turned so empty
I just keep wanderin' why
Will I ever find the love we share together you and I

Oh, it's you sweet baby
Though we've had such a long hard road to climb, sweet baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Won't you try and believe in what I say?, sweet baby

1979,Same Old Lang Syne,Dan Fogelberg,Dan Fogelberg,Same Old Lang Syne Dan Fogelberg,"Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stole behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve

She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse
And we laughed until we cried

We took her groceries to the checkout stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation dragged

Went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store
And we drank it in her car

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

She said she'd married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie

I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I
Saw doubt or gratitude

She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was hell

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
And tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how

We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving in our eloquence
Another 'auld lang syne'

The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away

Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain"

And it couldn't be found

That I couldn't get up
You know and
One day I was one of life's losers
Even my friends were my accusers
And in my head
Lost before I'd begun

I had a dream
But it turned to dust
What I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turn around
Fate must have woke her
'Cause lady luck she was
Waiting outside the door

I'm winning

I can see the day
That I breathe for
Friends agree there's a need
To play the game
And to win again

Of facing rainy days
And somehow we survive

We keep the feelings warm
Protect them from the storm
Until our time arrives

Then one day the sun appears
And we come shining through those lonely years

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through

When friends are hard to find
And life seems so unkind
Sometimes you feel afraid

Just aim beyond the clouds
And rise above the crowds
And start your own parade

Cause when I chased my fears away
That's when I knew that I could finally say

I made it through the rain
I kept my world protected
I made it throught the rain
I kept my point of view
I made it through the rain
And found myself respected
By the others who
Got rained on too
And made it through...

You really know me, that's all I need to know
Maybe I'm an open book
Because I know you're mine
But you won't need to read between the lines

The passions that collide in me
The wild abandoned side of me
Only for you, for your eyes only"

She fixes coffee while he takes a shower
Hey that was great, he said, I wish we could stay in bed
But I got to be at work in less than an hour
She manages a smile as he walks out the door
She's a modern girl who's been though this movie before

Chorus:
She don't build her world 'round no single man
But she's gettin' by, doin' what she can
She is free to be, what she wants to be
'N all what she wants to be, is a modern girl
Na na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na na, she's a modern girl

It looks like rain again, she takes a train again
She's on her way again through London town
Where she keeps a tangerine, flicks through a magazine
Until it's time to leave her dreams on the underground
She walks to the office like everyone else
An independent lady, takin' care of herself

Chorus

She's been dreaming 'bout it all day long
As soon as she gets home, it's him on the telephone
He asks her to dinner, she says I'm not free
Tonight I'm going to stay at home and watch my TV

I don't build my world 'round no single man
But I'm gettin' by, doin' what I can
I am free to be, what I want to be
'N all what I want to be, is a modern girl

You act like you were just born tonight
Face down in a memory but feeling all right
So who does your past belong to today?
Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way
The girls in the bars thinking, ""who is this guy?""
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full

[Chorus]
Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room""
The girls say, ""God I hope he comes back soon""

[Verse 2]
Everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around?
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown?
Splitting your dice to be someone you're not
You say you're looking for something you might've forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home

And love will make it all right, all right

Giving and taking and always mistaking
But I'll follow you woman , eternally

Don't give me no time to waste away
Love is love
Keep me alive to my dying day

And love will make it all right , all right

Setting my sights in one only direction
Searching for romance and showing affection
I guess I better know one, standing in the cold dark
Waiting for your love

Time is time
Don't give me no wrong in making love
Love is love, turn me around till you burn me up
Now is now, we master the world
And time will make it all right, all right

2005,Love Story,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,Love Story Taylor Swift,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Because we were both young when I first saw you"

Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies that's home
Then pop in the night cause it's meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot
Cause we be ballin', it's platinum Patron that be ours

My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belongs on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like dammit I know ya
Doing a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur cause

Well you done done me in, you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn, to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free

We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate

And bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

Up in the club, just broke up
I’m doing my own little thing

Cried my tears, three good years

How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend – well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold

Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects

No more stress, now I'm straight

Situation coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?

Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smokin' His last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything.""

When everything was fallin' apart?
All my days
Spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of 1st and Amistad

Everyone ends up alone
Losin' her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I want to be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Takin' all I want

2015,Knock You Down,Keri Hilson featuring Kanye West and Ne-Yo,Keri Hilson,Knock You Down Keri Hilson,"[Intro: Keri Hilson talking]
Not again
This ain't supposed to happen to me

[Break: Kanye West]
Keep rocking and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin'd up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, and kids
Every morning, I look at you and smile
Cause boy, you came around and you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Hook: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say
""Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today""
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp ship flying high
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky
Hey, so now I'm crashing
Don't know how it happened
But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would baby if I could
Miss Independent, to the fullest
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl sometimes love...

[Hook]
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be baby we just happened
So please don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average
For advice, OMG, you listen to that bitch
Woe is me baby this is tragic
Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall

[Hook]
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around, and it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down

[Outro: Keri Hilson and Ne-Yo]
Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Yeah
Won't see it coming when it happens
But when it happens
You're gonna feel it let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Yeah"

Then my pants got bigga, she already knew what to figga
Had her lookin' at her boyfriend like, ""Fuck, that nigga""

Now to the ballas poppin' bottles
With they henny in they cups screamin'
Money ain't a thing if it ain't throwin' it up in the sky
Hold your drinks up high

Who can buy they own bottles
If you lookin' like a model
When them broke fellas holla tell 'em bye
Hold your drinks up high

Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha

[Intro: T.I.]
Ay... this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
E'rybody right here
What you need to do is be thankful for the life you got, y'knowmsayin?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters

My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are

Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
You're gonna be, a shinin' star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far
Cause everyone knows, just who ya are-are
So live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (AYY! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life (OHH! Ayyy ayyy ayyy)
Cause I'm a paper chaser
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH)
Just livin' my life (AYY) my life (OHH)
My life (AYY) my life (OHH) just livin' my life

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin' your paper, and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin' (shinin')
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my liiiife
And I'll never stop it

And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home

When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til the nigga hit the jackpot

All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping

Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows

You're delusional, you're delusional

She's staring at me, I'm sitting wondering what she's thinking
Nobody's talking, 'cause talking just turns into screaming

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, SYSTEM OVERLOAD
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—you lose

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me


[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

[Bridge]
It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't understand
How it feels to love a girl someday
You'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy..."

The world slows down
But my heart beats fast right now
I know this is the part
Where the end starts

Slipping through our fingers
I don't wanna try now

This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life, the one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing, I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting, will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath, right up 'til the end
Until that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

[Chorus]
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's got to be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's got to be somebody for me out there

[Verse 2]
Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit this feels too right, it's just like déja vu
Me standing here with you
So I'll be holding my breath, could this be the end?
Is it that moment when, I find the one that I'll spend forever with

Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's got to be somebody for me like that
Cause nobody wants to do it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's got to be somebody for me out there

You can't give up, (when you're looking for)
A diamond in the rough (cause you never know)
When it shows up, (make sure you're holding on)
Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on
Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's got to be somebody for me, oh

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to go it on their own
And everyone wants to know they're not alone
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's got to be somebody for me out there
Nobody wants to be the last one there
Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere
There's got to be somebody for me out there"

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice, feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus 1]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus 2]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"

My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield
Can't go back now

Said, ooh, there's something about
The kind of woman that want you but don't need you
And I can't figure it out
There's something about her

Cause she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss
Do what a boss
Do, she got me thinking about getting involved

There's something about her

Car and a crib, she 'bout to pay them both off

You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
The disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac

Why do I tire of counting sheep?
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep (Haha)

[Verse 3]
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason

And now i think that I've got it all down
And as i say it louder, I love how it sounds
Cause I'm not taking the easy way out

Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise i won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that i stayed till' today
Yeah, you and i will be a tough act to follow
But i know in time we'll find this was no surprise

It came out like a river once i let it out
When i thought that I wouldn't know how
Held on to it forever just pushing it down
Felt to good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons, shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise i won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that i stayed till' today
There's Nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul here to say
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah, you and i will be a tough act to follow
But i know in time we'll find this was no surprise

Our favorite place that we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise

If i could see the future and how this plays out
I bet its better than where we are now
But after going through this its easier to see the reason why

Its no surprise i won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that i stayed till' today
Yeah you and i will be a tough act to follow
But i know in time we'll find this was no surprise

The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wrong and right, our memories (our memories)
The whispering before we sleep
Just one more thing that you can't keep (you can't keep)

Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
But i know in time we'll find this was no surprise"

Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday

So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you all about it

I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline

Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys

And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby

Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare

My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

[Chorus 1]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day
(If today was your last day)

[Verse 2]
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

[Bridge]
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love

You already know what it is (ah)
We got another one boy (A-T-L)
Yeah, (just throw it in the bag)
What's up Brooklyn? What's up son?
(What's up Fabo?)
Aye man, I got that black AmEx with me
A.K.A. that ""Throw It In The Bag"" card
(Radio Killa), yeah

[Break - The-Dream]
Now I know you ain't over there staring at my girl
Yeah, I know you ain't over there staring at my girl
Nigga, I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
Now I know you don't call yourself hollering at my girl
I keep her in Louboutin, Louis Vuitton
Gucci down to her feet, yup, just like me
I'm the one, with them ones
Fuck the price on the tag, just throw it in the bag

[Hook - The-Dream]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Just throw it in the bag

[Fabolous talking over the Hook]
Ladies, y'all ready to go shopping?
Neiman Marcus on me and all that?
Yeah, come on then

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Look at price tags, where they do that at?
Heard that in A-T-L, when I'm in A-T-L
Just ask my baby gal, I treat that lady well
Ain't nothing so-so, and I know J.D. well
A couple Benzes, black, white, gray C.L
Got niggas looking like, ""Did we miss a Mercedes sale?""
Don't wonder what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louis on my labi-el's
That's the way we feel -- must be nice, man
You with the right man, you ain't gotta price scan
Or ask how much, now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn -- what it look like?
You get it cause I got it, I got it so you get it
In Miami they say, ""Don't stop, get it, get it""
Mami do the Speedy, daddy do the duffle
Bag full of chips, we ain't talking Ruffles

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
See, I know what I'mma tell her
The same thing that the bank robber told the teller --
Just throw it in the bag
That's the way it supposed to be
A real nigga 'posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket
That Remy Mar' got him spitting plenty bars
Broke ass nigga, couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso, he ain't got to know so
Such a gentleman, dozen bottles of that Rose Mo'
Oh you got a man? Well, you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the plates say ""GET U 1""
Meet me at the register, I'm there on the regular
Them niggas price checking, you can help them in a second
As we proceed to give you what you need
Like we breaking down the weed
Shorty, throw it in the bag

You made me want you oh so bad it hurt
But girl, in case you haven't heard

I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying, say hello to goodbye
'Cause just one sip would make me sick
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever, but now it's over

Hot sweat and blurry eyes
We're spinning round a roller coaster ride
The world stuck in black and white
You drove me crazy every time we touched
Now I'm so broken that I can't get up
Oh girl, you make me such a lush

I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever, forever is over
We used to kiss all night, now it's just a bar fight
So don't call me crying, say hello to goodbye
'Cause just one sip would make me sick
I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever, but now it's over

All the time I wasted on you
All the bullshit you put me through
Checking into rehab 'cause everything that we had
Didn't mean a thing to you

I used to be love drunk, but now I'm hungover
I'll love you forever, but now I'm sober

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off

Drink my drink and smoke my weed

Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon

Um yea, of course I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'til the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun

And I just laughed and said you all get in

She was looking too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do baby I don't care

We can stay right here

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now"

Do you know what's worth fighting for
When it's not worth dying for?
Does it take your breath away
And you feel yourself suffocating?
Does the pain weigh out the pride?
And you look for a place to hide?
Did someone break your heart inside?
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky
You and I

[Verse 2]
When you're at the end of the road
And you lost all sense of control
And your thoughts have taken their toll
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul
Your faith walks on broken glass
And the hangover doesn't pass
Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins

One, twenty-one guns
Lay down your arms
Give up the fight
One, twenty-one guns
Throw up your arms into the sky

When you burned down the house and home?
Did you stand too close to the fire?

You know I like my chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

[Verse 1]
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

[Chorus]
And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 2]
It's funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree, have a drink with me
Raise you glasses for a toast

[Chorus]
To a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Verse 3]
I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly, let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives so we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

[Chorus]
Like our chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

[Chorus 2]
Get your little chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
Well I've seen the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love"

And once again
I thought I loved you then

Are you in?
Living in sin is the new thing
Yeah, are you in?
I am counting

1, 2, 3

Got one eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between
Counting, 1, 2, 3

Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves counting
Counting, 1, 2, 3
Peter, Paul and Mary
Getting down with 3P
Everybody loves counting

What we do is innocent
Just for fun and nothing meant
If you don't like the company
Let's just do it, you and me
You and me, or three
Or four, on the floor

1, 2, 3
Not only you and me
Got one eighty degrees, and I'm caught in between

[Hook]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

I run from hate
I run from prejudice
I run from pessimists

I run my life
Or is it running me?
Run from my past
I run too fast
Or too slow it seems
When lies become the truth
That's when I run to you

This world keeps spinning faster
Into a new disaster, so I run to you
I run to you baby
And when it all starts coming undone
Baby you're the only one I run to
I run to you

We run on fumes
Your life and mine
Like the sands of time
Slipping right on through
And our love's the only truth
That's why I run to you

Oh sweetheart, put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure you've found it
Slow motion sparks
You caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh yes they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh no I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand
And your heart on your sleeve
Oh no I do not hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last
But this is now
So love the one you're with
You want a chase
But you're chasing your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh no I do not hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand
And your heart on your sleeve
Oh no I do not hook up, up

Cause the more that you try
The harder I'll fight

Between us
Could be over
With a snap of your finger

Keep your hand in my hand

2093,People Are Crazy,Billy Currington,Billy Currington,People Are Crazy Billy Currington,"This old man and me, were at the bar
And we were having us some beers and swaping I don't cares
Talking politics, blonde and red-head chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace and all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

He said ""I fought two wars
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""
We talked an hour or two about every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do

We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
He said ""These damn things will kill me yet
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy""

Last call it's 2am, I said goodbye to him
I never talk to him again
Then one sunny day, I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary, he was a millionaire
He left his fortune to some guy he barely knew, his kids were mad as hell
But me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today, to just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack right there on his grave and I said
God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy

God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy

God is great, beer is good, and people are crazy"

She's got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

[Chorus]
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

[Verse 2]
You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife

When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

Looking at you makes it harder

You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your prettywings around
Prettywings, your prettywings
Your prettywings around

I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies

I turned day into night
Sleep till I died a thousand times
I shoulda showed you
Better night better times better days
And I miss you more, and more

[Hook:]
If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your prettywings around
Prettywings, your prettywings your
Prettywings, your prettywings around

Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexable
Professional, drinkin' X and oh
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes

Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a solider, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her

Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack

I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin'

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Verse 2]
Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love

2113,Viva la Vida,Coldplay,Coldplay,Viva la Vida Coldplay,"[Verse 1]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice, feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus 1]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus 2]
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"

This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just want to try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right

I hold on so nervously
To me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far, has not been good
It’s been shitty
And I feel awkward, as I should
This club has got to be
The most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well I am imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

[Hook]
Well I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still
If your body matches
What your eyes can do
You’ll probably move right through
Me on my way to you

[Verse 2]
I hold out for one more drink
Before I think
I’m looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun
I should just stay home
If one thing really means one
This club will hopefully
Be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well I’m still imagining
A dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Well I’m not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you
I want to make you move
Because you’re standing still

No matter what you say about love
I keep coming back for more
Keep my hand in the fire, sooner or later
I'll get what I'm asking for
No matter what you say about life
I learn every time I bleed
That truth is a stranger, soul is in danger
I gotta let my spirit be free

To admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind
Sorry, but I have to move on and leave you behind

I can't waste time so give it a moment
I realize, nothing's broken

Live every second like it was my last one
Don't look back at a new direction

You're still apart of everything I do
You're on my heart just like a tattoo
Just like a tattoo, I'll always have you
I'll always have you, I'll always have you

Marks everything I do

Steady hands, just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal, for the life I lead

But I've become what I can't be, oh

And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see

Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious, they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still, I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin' problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

Before he speak his suit bespoke
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash

And I'm feeling like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

Young Money! You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual, bleed
Through the pencil, I leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
And she ain't shy no more: she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
It ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: you ain't got shit

Motherfucker, I say: ""Life ain't shit without me.""

The sleepless nights and the tears you cried
It's never too late to make it right

When I peeped this lil' ho out
I was all in the bar, wind drift up
Shawty Redd came on then she hit the floor now
With a see-through, dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Ms. Bo Peep and a nigga know
If I take her home, with them wide ass hips
You damn right, I'm gon' beep
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Big ass booty with a little bitty waist
I whisped in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?""
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shit
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some fuck faces
But it wasn't no use for me to rush to bust one
Cause I wanted her to have a eruption

Can’t keep my eyes away from you, girl
When you get on the floor and do what you do
And everybody wanna come back to that body
The kind that remind me something like you
‘Cause you’re the type that drive a man crazy
And snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back
He'll end up callin' you, baby
And they never really know what to do
Once you expose that thing you do
You had him crawlin' on hands and knees
And you find a way to get him out that cheese
And why you thinking you're the only dude?

Lettin' everybody know she got you

Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me loving all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's only pulling me down
It’s getting harder to breathe
It won’t be too long and I will be going under
Can you save me from this?

Cause it’s not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it’s not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Oh but I won’t go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take them away
Oh but I'm taking them back
Cause all of this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friends this life we live, it’s not what we have
It’s what we believe in

And it’s not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me but it’s not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know

This could be the end of me

Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings

If I'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings, but that's the path
I believe in, and I know that time will heal it

Yes, I will!

Never thought that she would come and work for the president
Mr. George Washington (where my money at?)
She thought he'd call (where my money at?)
She had a good day, bad day, sunny day, rainy day
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
Closed legs don't get fed
Go out there and make my bread
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)
She ended up in the wrong car
Bruised up, scarred hard
All he wanna know is (where my money at?)

Pimpin' got harder 'cause hoes got smarter
On the strip is somethin' they don't wanna be a part of
Rather be up in the club, shakin' for a dub
Get triple times the money and spendin' it like they wanna
They got they mind on they money, money on they mind
They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the 9
See, everyday they feel the struggle but stayin' on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line
But I know there's a drop in the block
You move slow, you gettin' pressure from cops
You don't know whether or not to lay low
'Cause 25 to life is no joke
To all my real guerillas thuggin'
On top of corners every day strugglin'
All the beautiful women's gettin' money
Washin' them dollar bills like laundry

Whatever, now she like sour amaretto
She wears a dress to the T like the letter
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather
She used to run track back in high school
Now she tricks on the track right by school
She take the loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, or pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she ask him: ""Where my money at?""

2161,One Step at a Time,Jordin Sparks,Jordin Sparks,One Step at a Time Jordin Sparks,"[Verse 1]
Hurry up and wait
So close
But so far away
Everything
That you've always dreamed of
Close enough for you to taste
But you just can't touch

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna show the world
But no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where
And how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face
As the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient
Waiting

[Chorus]
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen
When it's supposed to happen
That we find the reasons why
One step at a time

[Verse 2]
You believe and you doubt
You're confused
And got it all figured out
Everything that you always wished for
Could be yours, should be yours
Would be yours
If they only knew

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanna show the world
But no one knows your name yet
Wonder when and where
And how you're gonna make it
You know you can if you get the chance
In your face
As the door keeps slamming
Now you're feeling more and more frustrated
And you're getting all kind of impatient
Waiting

[Chorus]
We live and we learn to take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen
When it's supposed to happen
That we find the reasons why
One step at a time

[Bridge]
When you can't wait any longer
But there's no end in sight
(When you need to find the strength)
It's the faith that makes you stronger
The only way you get there
Is one step at a time

[Chorus]
We take
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen
When it's supposed to happen
That we find the reasons why
One step at a time
One step at a time
There's no need to rush
It's like learning to fly
Or falling in love
It's gonna happen
When it's supposed to happen
That we find the reasons why
One step at a time"

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you (yeah)
That's how much I need you (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Rihanna & Ne-Yo / Both]
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)
But you won't let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Ne-Yo)]
And I hate how much I love you boy (yeah)
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)
And I hate how much I love you boy (oh whoa)
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so (oh)

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo & Rihanna]
You completely know the power that you have (power that you have)
The only one makes me laugh (one makes me laugh)
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I...
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right

And I hate how much I love you girl (oooh)
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)

One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me (hmm)
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

As much as I need you

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh (the return)
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to catch his microphone, check 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too
Ha ha ha ha-ha-ha

[Hook: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, unless it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gonna clap and they ain't gonna praise
They want everything back that they've paid
Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha-ha-ha

[Hook: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha ha ha-ha-ha
Ha ha ha-ha-ha, ha""

[Hook: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

If you are, what you say you are
Then have no fear"

Now even though I try to play it off
I'm thinkin' 'bout you all day long
And I can't wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you

Got me fiendin' for her love, can't lie
Man, you should see how she got me
Spendin' all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do

Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me

And my fingers all in your hair
I wonder if you feel me watchin' you
Cause I can't go a night without your lovin'
Got me lookin' at this phone
Every time it rings, I hope it's you, girl

Got me bracin' for your love
And I've fallen for you, I can't lie
I just wanna be with you
And yes, she got me there, I said it
Somebody call the paramedics
Tell 'em to hurry up and come through

I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me
I'm goin' outta my mind

Don't ever leave me, girl
I need you inside my world
I can't go a day without you
And see, nobody else will ever do
I'll never feel like I feel with you

Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me
I suffocate when you're away from me
So much love you take from me

I can't breathe when you talk to me

You live a lie, live a lie, live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed

Diamonds on my pinky, hand on the pine

Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga, what
Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got Gs on my ass, bitch it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck

My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm but then she slit both wrists
There go them suicide doors, wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes and got duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose, the white boys go, ""Sweet""

And got an entourage and her own paparazzi
Now, there she go again, ridin' through the stormy weather

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, SYSTEM OVERLOAD
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—you lose

[Verse 3]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lock-down—you lose

That you would ever feel the same way about me
Just too much, just too much

All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it really just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away-ay-ay
Going away-ay-ay

Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl?
Are we just friends? Is there more? Is there more?

Something that will last, last forever, forever

Then put yo' hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, ooooh I'm GOOD!"

Superstar, where you from? How's it going?
I know you got a clue what you're doing
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you getting more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Faking like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

[Chorus]
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby

Daddy-O, you got the swagger of champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me for a sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way, I'm never gonna fall for you
Never you, baby

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan
Ahh Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh Ahh

Splashing through the sand bar
Talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life, like when and where
We didn't have no internet
But man, I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

[Hook]
And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

[Verse 2]
Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun
We couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock and roll

And we were trying different things
We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing Sweet home Alabama all summer long

Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I'll hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think man I'd love to see that girl again

We were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow

Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood

I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thang

Aye, babe, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin', though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no Visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar

I probably shouldn't say this, but at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we've shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever going to change until you hear, my dear
The 7 things I hate about you

[Chorus 1]
The 7 things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Verse 2]
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now is your sincere apology
And when you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking 7 steps here

[Chorus 1]
The 7 things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

[Bridge]
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the 7 that I like

[Chorus 2]
The 7 things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
And when we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined everything's alright
I want to be with the one I know
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you
You do, oh"

She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you

[Chorus]
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

[Verse 2]
Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down

[Chorus]
Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

[Verse 3]
Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing
One kid's crying, one kid's screaming
She keeps apologizing
He says, they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36, one's 23
Heh... It's hard to believe, but

[Chorus]
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast

So take a good look around

2194,Love Remains the Same,Gavin Rossdale,Gavin Rossdale,Love Remains the Same Gavin Rossdale,"A thousand times I’ve seen you standing
Gravity like a lunar landing
Make me want to run till I find you
I shut the world away from here
Drift to you, you’re all I hear
Everything we know fades to black

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

Find the place where we escape
Take you with me for a space
The city buzz, it sounds just like a fridge
I walk the streets through seven bars
I had to find just where you are
The faces seem to blur, they’re all the same

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending

I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
But love remains the same

So much more to say
So much to be done
Don’t you trick me out
We shall overcome
So all have stayed in place
We should have had the sun
Could have been inside
Instead we’re over here

Half the time the world is ending
Truth is I am done pretending
Too much time, too long defending
You and I are done pretending

I never thought that I had anymore to give
Pushing me so far
Here I am without you
Drink to all that we have lost
Mistakes we have made
Everything will change
Everything will change

I, oh I
I wish this could last forever
I, oh I
As if we could last forever

Love remains the same
Love remains the same"

[Intro: Juicy J]
Yeah ya'll know what it is
Katy Perry, Juicy J
Uh huh, let's rage!

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I knew you were, you were gonna come to me
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I, I'm capable of anything
Of anything, and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don't make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Mark my words, this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
We're down to earth if you choose to walk away
Don't walk away
It's in the palm of your hand now, baby
It's a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure before you give it all to me
All to me, give it all to me

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
She's a beast, I call her Karma
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart is on steroids, 'cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She's sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma (Woo!)
Damn, I think I love her, shawty's so bad, I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster, turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug, I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope, I messed around and got addicted

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back"

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out

My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

I was left to my own devices
Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Great clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?

We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us

(Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?)
Great clouds roll over the hills bringing darkness from above
(Oh, where do we begin, the rubble or our sins?)

[Chorus]
But if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like you've been here before?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
How am I going to be an optimist about this?
If you close your eyes
Does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?

Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
Just cause everybody doing what they all do
If one thing I know - I'll fall, but I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home

For thinking that we could be something for real?

Trying to reach the things that I can't see

My prediction - I'mma be on top of the world
Walk your walk, and don't look back
Always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life

Fight for yours, and don't let go
Don't let them compare you, no
Don't worry, you're not alone

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it
‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin' will do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin' into somethin', still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head

Call all the ladies out, they're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats

Now bring my boys in, their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
Even the comatose, they don't dance and tell

We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know we're on each other's team

So there

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
Cause what this palace wants is release

We live in cities you'll never see onscreen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow

Only know you love her when you let her go

Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low

Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go

The cold never bothered me anyway

[Verse 2]
It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all!

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free!

[Chorus 2]
Let it go, let it go
I'm one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand, and here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on!

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past!

[Chorus 3]
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on!
The cold never bothered me anyway"

When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So baby now rest in peace (It's all over with now)

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You should've known better than to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya, gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora & (Iggy Azalea)]
You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave

[Verse 2]
Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit, by the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills, and he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun...

It's a shot in the dark, but I'll make it

Cause baby you’re worth it

Cause baby you’re worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah


[Bridge]
No I won’t fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

[Chorus]
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah"

[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus ]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You’re gonna hear me roar

Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up (hey)

Yeah you can find us where the party's at

Baby, you're so classic

Baby you're class, and baby you're sick

A star in the 40's, center fold in the 50's
You got met tripping out like the 60's, hippies
Queen of the discotheque
A 70's dream and an 80's best
Hepburn, Beyonce, Marilyn, Massey
Girl you're timeless
Just so classic

I met this girl late last year
She said ""don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 2]
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

[Verse 3]
(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing

[Hook]
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe

Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe"

And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days

Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

I'll tell you something, 1968 was just another year, the fields needed tilling and there wasn't enough rain. But it was the first year Rosie started bringing my lunch out to the field every day

[Verse 1]
You get your hands in it
Plant your roots in it
Dusty head light, dance with your boots in it (dirt)
You write her name on it
Spin your tires on it
Build your corn field, whiskey, bonfires on it (dirt)
You bet your life on it, yeah
It's that...

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Interlude 1]
Rosie and I had five children, one died at birth, they were tough times, tough years, did okay

[Verse 2]
You've mixed some sweat with it
Taking a shovel to it
You've stuck some crosses and some painted
Goal posts through it (dirt)
You know you came from it (dirt)
And some day you'll return to

Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

[Interlude 2]
I asked Rosie one time if she wanted to travel to see the world, and no she said ""the world comes right to my window every day""... Even if it's broken
(You know you came from it (dirt, dirt) And some day you'll return to)

[Chorus]
Elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
That plowed up ground, that your dad damned his luck on
That post game party field you circle up on
And when it rains you get stuck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
And mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
Her blue-eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

Makes you wanna build a 10 percent down white picket fence house on this dirt

See Rosie was right about two things: you don't have to see the world to be worldly, just raise good children, make good enough pies and the world will come right to your kitchen window. She's right about something else too, I built that baseball diamond way too close to the kitchen

[Verse 1]
You can be amazing
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
Or be the backlash of somebody’s lack of love
Or you can start speaking up
Nothing’s gonna hurt you the way that words do
When they settle ‘neath your skin
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins
But I wonder what would happen if you

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

[Post-Chorus]
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I wanna see you be brave

[Verse 2]
Everybody’s been there
Everybody’s been stared down by the enemy
Fallen for the fear
And done some disappearing
Bow down to the mighty
Don’t run, stop holding your tongue
Maybe there’s a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is

[Chorus]
Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave

[Bridge]
And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good
Did you think it would?
Let your words be anything but empty
Why don't you tell them the truth?

Say what you wanna say
And let the words fall out
Honestly I wanna see you be brave
With what you want to say
And let the words fall out

Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high waisted shorts, oh

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour

Make it like your birthday every day
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

So make a wish
I'll make it like your birthday every day
I'll be your gift
Give you something good to celebrate

2281,Bartender,Lady Antebellum,Lady Antebellum,Bartender Lady Antebellum,"[Verse 1]
8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Saying ""come on he ain’t worth the pain""
""Do what you gotta do to forget his name""
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

[Chorus]
What I’m really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Verse 2]
Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
Cause tonight it’s all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay

[Chorus]
What I’m really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Bridge]
I’m feeling that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m coming in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Hey Bartender
What I’m really needing now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender
Hey bartender"

He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that

Said, ""Not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes""
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory
The way you make me feel, yeah, you gotta hold on me
I've never met someone so different
Oh, here we go
You a part of me now
You a part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

Ohh Ohh I can't remember to forget you
Ohh Ohh I keep forgetting I should let you go
But when you look at me
The only memory is us kissing in the moonlight
Ohh Ohh I can't remember to forget you
Ohh Ohh I can't remember to forget you

I go back again
Fall off the train
Land in his bed
Repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I'm trying to say is not to forget
You see only the good, selective memory

The way he makes me feel
I never seemed to act so stupid
Oh, here we go
He a part of me now

So where he goes I follow, follow, follow

[Verse 1]
I drove by all the places
We used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss
How it felt, the way it tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely
Even though he’s right beside you
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2]
The pictures that you sent me
They're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them
I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking
Why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy
Yeah it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name
When I haven't seen you in so long

It’s like we never happened
Was it just a lie?
If what we had was real
How could you be fine?
Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
Cause I'm not fine at all

[Bridge]
If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

[Chorus]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

I be in the club standing on the couch
In them Wolf Greys like it's my house
Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect
Looking like a model, who just got a check
I back it up, cause I don't give a fuck
If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us
I'm MC Hammer fly, you can't touch
J's so fly I should work at Flight Club

Just watching her blonde hair, sun burn, stare at them
Whitecaps rolling over
Laid back in a thrift store beach chair
Dropping limes in her Corona
Well she looks back, yeah, she throws me a kiss
Like ""Honey, I sure want you""
And it's a hundred and three between her and me
And only 92 in Daytona

And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, so tight
Rolling white sand, cold can koozie in my hand, just a summertime strollin'
Chillin', breezin', sippin', singin' woah a oh, oh

We got 2-for-1s, we're at a margarita bar
Whatever happens happens
And there's a reggae band, full of dread heads
Just sittin' in the corner laughing
Well my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a jar
She smiles and shakes it at me
Yeah, she gets 'em going, she gets 'em playing
A little, don't worry be happy

I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Hook: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, there's a problem with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Hook: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had her inhaling my love, tryna blow my mind
Cadillac pimpin’, my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving and smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keeping the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all, kill the fucking whips
See what's popping at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my balls
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga, fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished

Would you wanna run away too?

See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking babe

High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
Cuz when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Had to back it on up, couldn't make it to the service
Grabbed all the cash underneath my mattress
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

Ran into a girl in a pretty white dress
Rolled down a window, where you headed to next?
Said I'm heading to the bar with my money out of the mattress
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

Stand on the box, stomp your feet, start clapping
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa...something bad
Whoa...something bad

We're rollin' down the road, down to New Orleans
Got a full tank of gas and the money out of the mattress

Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen
Drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
Wake up in the morning, don't know what happened
Whoa...something bad

Wondering where you've been all my life
I just started living

Of men armed with weapons

I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I've
Never been this swept away

All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe
It's washing over me
Suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
I'm closer than I've ever felt before
And I know
And you know
There's no need for words right now

It's washing over me

I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

2304,I Wanna Know,Joe,Joe,I Wanna Know Joe,"[Intro: Joe Budden]
How's everybody feeling out there? We good? Let's talk to the sample right quick. I always pictured we'd be. It go like this. Listen

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Let me tell you how I pictured this
A few houses, a couple businesses
Striving for greatness, we would be each other's witnesses
And during beef, we both would put aside our differences
Where I ain't flinch a bit making you insignificant
Maybe kids and shit, perfect arithmetic
Meaning we could build our own world and co-exist in it
She a synergy, sharing energy
Let our souls mate in the air if you remember me
Now here's what I did with it
Went out my way to fuck these stripper chicks
Lost good girls making them mistresses
Just savages, missed marriages
They all was my babies, I needed those miscarriages
My worthless self when Joe felt hurt
I went out and targeted women who had no self worth
I relate to praying nightly feeling no spell work
When you can do it, but a stranger gotta go help first
I called moms on the phone, here's what I told her real quick
I said my 20s flew by with no control of the shit
Her next sentence swear that I’ll forever hold with a grip
She said it go by even faster as the older you get
I wanna never dumb down, I'd have to lower my wit
Ain't gotta post this on the Gram for you to know what it is
A partner to trust, I'm thinking even bigger for us
Mom should've told me this when we had shit to discuss
Now neither one of us is how we figured we’d be
Sometimes the thought of what if still lives here with me
I always pictured we'd be

[Interlude: Joe Budden]
Nah'mean? That's how I see it in my head though. Ain't quite pan out like that. Word up. Let me tell you about some more of God's work though

[Hook: Stacy Barthe]
I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know

[Interlude: Joe Budden]
Nah, I like it just like that, Parks, let it run
Lemme go right here, right here, right here
Look, Look

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
A love that's tideful, never prideful
If you're truly better without me how can I spite you?
As I yearn for the greatest love I ever had
Pardon me, kid, I'm still learning how to be a dad
We be in spots you shouldn't be in 'till you grown
I was absent so long I'm just not leaving you home
So nah, too much to learn, too much world out there
Let me teach you about these hoes, too many girls out there
I respect your mom's tutelage
But that's my weird and my brain, what's she gon' do with this?
Watch and learn, foolish kid
Eyes light up with surprise, you're just like I am
I think that you're enjoying this ride just like I am
Look, same pedigree, theoretically
Cut from a cloth that was gone, that's just genetically
One job in life to make you a much better me
Greater feeling than I imagine this shit would ever be
You be feeling strong when you diss me in songs
I did the same my whole career, would never tell you it's wrong
Whatever works out, whatever the price, get that embedded
Even if at my expense, I'll pay it, you take the credit
Had a power struggle when I thought your mom abused it
My hands were in bondage, useless
Beyond the excuses, calm through it
It’s crazy, our bond music
And we do it beautifully for our beautiful conduit
So right now I stand in a place I never stood before
Finally filled the void in my life, I wasn't good before
Fucking with these hoes, that energy I was putting forth
God, this was more like the fucking love I was looking for
Now it's better than we pictured it'd be
And the supervised visits, we'll never have to relive it
Little nigga we'll be

[Interlude]
This is greater than us. Greater than me. Greater than anything I could ever imagine, man. I ain't talking to everbody. Trey, what up though? What up? What up?

[Hook: Stacy Barthe]
I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know
I wanna know what this life's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know, ah
I wanna know what this love's supposed to be like
I wanna know, wanna know"

Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Verse 2]
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

[Verse 3]
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Chorus 2]
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know"

Up high I feel like I'm alive for the very first time
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets"

It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky
It's been a long time, we shouldn't have left you
Without a dope beat to step to, step to, step to, step to
Step to, step to, freaky-freaky
Baby girl,oh

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
What would you do, to get to me?
What would you say, to have your way?
Would you give up, or try again
If I hesitated to let you in?
Now would you be yourself or play your role?
Tell all the boys, I keep it low
If I say no, would you turn away
Or play me off, or would you stay?

[Hook]
And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (and again)

[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
I'm into you, you into me
But I can't let it go so easily
Not 'til I see, whether this could be
Could be eternity, or just a week
Ayo our chemistry is off the chain
It's perfect now, but will it change?
This ain't a yes, this ain't a no
Just do your thing, we'll see how it goes

[Hook]
And if at first you don't succeed
Then dust yourself off and try again
You can dust it off and try again, try again
Cause if at first you don't succeed
You can dust it off and try again
Dust yourself off and try again, try again (and again)

You don't wanna throw it all away
I might be shy on the first date, what about the next date
Huh, huh, huh, huh
I said you don't wanna throw it all away
I might be bugging on the first date, what about the next date?
Huh, huh, huh, huh

Ooh
Oh yeah yeah
Listen

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still I'm lonely now

Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
So I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Said without you girl ahh
Listen

Your perfume, your sexy lingerie
Girl I remember it just like it was on yesterday
A Thursday you told me you had fallen in love
I wasn't sure that I was

It's been a year, winter, summer, spring and fall
But bein' without you just ain't livin' ain't nothing at all
If I could travel back in time
I'd relive the days you were mine

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete
Oh yeah that without you girl ahh

I just can't help lovin' you
But I loved you much too late
I'd give anything
And everything
To hear you say
That you'll stay

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything
But I can't pretend that I don't see
That without you girl my life is incomplete

Even though it seems I have everything
I don't wanna be a lonely fool
All of the women, all the expensive cars
All of the money don't amount to you
I can make believe I have everything

Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa what

Light it up and take a puff, pass it to me now

You can find me in St. Louis rolling on dubs
Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like Cocoa Puffs
Sipping Bud', getting perved and getting dubbed
Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs
And it's all because accumulated enough scratch
Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome
And it's candy painted, fans fainting while I'm entertaining
Wild, ain't it? How me and money get acquainted
I hang with Hannibal Lecter, hot shit,so feel me when I bring it
Sing it loud, I'm from the Lou' and I'm proud
Run a mile for the cause, I'm righteous above the law
Player my style's raw, I'm Born to Mack, like Todd Shaw
Forget the fame and the glamour, give me D's with a rubber hammer
My grammar be's Ebonics, gin, tonic, and chronic
Fuck Bionic, it's ironic, slamming niggas like Onyx
Lunatics 'til the day I die, I run more game than the Bulls and Sonics

[Doom]
Ba-di-yahhhh
Alright, steady
Ba-di-yah, ba-di-yah

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded then {*AHEM*}

Good to the last drop niglets
Hood 'til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses' dicks or higher
Beatwalkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth, play alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosy federalies yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your Nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell get lighted on sight
The ringer's on a need-to-know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you're on your own, acted alone
Back home your fam'll be provided for while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice bring back eyes, fingers, toes and pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers and fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves and strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send them a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double espresso, D.A. latte
No smell nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stretches
A long list of C.O.'s names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
That sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system scared in doubt with a fear stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught him
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when Terminator killed Tookie
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the Villain surrounded, son, then shit
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud, red flood

""Villain""

[Outro]
One of the things we ran into the unknown
We we couldn't get at the door pulled as quick as we wanted to
And once we did, finally pull the door and breach the interior door
There's a man trapped inside of it
Basically that man trap is a cage
'Fore we run in, we're stuck in there and they can shoot us
While we're just, we're stuck in a cage"

No one but you got me feeling this way
There's so much we can't explain
Maybe we're helping each other escape
I'm with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Who knows the secret tomorrow will hold?
We don't really need to know
Cause you're here with me now, I don't want you to go
You're here with me now, I don't want you to go

[Chorus]
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Maybe it's not forever
Maybe the night will change us
Maybe we'll stay together
Maybe we'll walk away
Maybe we'll realize
We're only human
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over
Maybe we're perfect strangers
Come on, come on, come over
Maybe we don't need no reason why
Come on, come on, come over"

[Verse 1: Sting]
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems

I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love

[Cheb Mami]
Aman aman aman
Omry feek antia
Ma ghair antia
Ma ghair antia

[Verse 2: Sting]
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

Sweet desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower
This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Hook]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, ‘cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush, that I just did not want
Paid, was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, getting paid was everything

[Pre-Chorus]
But I am not every girl and I do not need that world to validate me
'Cause shorty has got a job, shorty has got a car

Do not want to dance if it is not in my heart

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Do not want to dance if he cannot be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me

To be giving you diamond rings

Because shorty has got a job, shorty has got a car

I think thoughts that I know are bad
Close my eyes and I count to ten
Hope it's over when I open them

I want the things that I had before
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door
I wish I could count to ten
Make everything be wonderful again

Hope my mom and I hope my dad
Will figure out why they get so mad
Hear them scream, I hear them fight
They say bad words that make me wanna cry

Close my eyes when I go to bed
And I dream of angels who make me smile
I feel better when I hear them say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world's so big
I just don't understand how
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes
Tell me everything is wonderful now

Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now

I tell the kids that it's all okay
I laugh aloud so my friends won't know
When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home

Go to my room and I close my eyes
I make believe that I have a new life
I don't believe you when you say
Everything will be wonderful someday

Promises mean everything when you're little
And the world is so big

You can smile with all those tears in your eyes

I hate everything

We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!

[Hook 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T.
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

[Hook 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T.
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that cane
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!

[Hook 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B.L.A.D.'s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T.
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B"
