Now
The mist across the window hides the lines
But nothing hides the color of the lights that shine
Electricity so fine
Look and dry your eyes

[Verse 2: Joe Jackson]
We
So tired of all the darkness in our lives
With no more angry words to say can come alive
Get into a car and drive
To the other side

[Chorus: Joe Jackson]
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light

[Verse 3: Joe Jackson]
We
Are young but getting old before our time
We'll leave the T.V. and the radio behind
Don't you wonder what we'll find
Steppin' out tonight?

[Verse 4: Joe Jackson]
You
Can dress in pink and blue just like a child
And in a yellow taxi turn to me and smile
We'll be there in just a while
If you follow me

[Chorus: Joe Jackson] x2
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
You babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light
Me babe, steppin' out
Into the night
Into the light"

Ooh deep inside you realize
You're gonna see me wherever you go
You're gonna hear me on your radio
There you are in your car
And suddenly
You hear me
""Do you want me
Do you want me""

Take me to heart
I promise you a miracle
Take me to heart
You're gonna be mine
Take me to heart
You know it's just a matter of time

I'm always on your mind
I'm the chill that never left your spine
In the building where you live and breathe
I'm the sound that never lets you sleep
Down the hall through the walls
You hear a voice that's calling
""Do you want me
Do you want me""

Take me to heart
Don't deny the miracle
Take me to heart
What more can I say
Take me to heart
Surrender's just a motion away

Wondering where you're at today
And I've been hanging by the telephone
Hopin' that you'd call home and stay

You told me you needed
More walks, more talks
More feelin' close to me
I wanna be close to you

I didn't know you needed
Some roses, some romance
A little candlelight and slow dance
That's not how it's been
But maybe we can try again
Try, try, maybe we can try again

I remember all the days gone by
And I'm wonderin' why I couldn't see
I could search the whole world over
And never find what you were always giving me

I told you I needed
More time, more space, more freedom
(Free to do) free to do, girl
What you wanna do

I gave you no roses, no romance
No candlelight and no slow dance
But that's just how it's been
Maybe we can try again
Try, try, maybe we can try again
Try, try, maybe we can try again, yeah

You told me you needed
More walks, more talks
More feelin' close to me

How long you gonna carry on
This one on one charade?
Let's don't and then say we did
That's the game you like to play
Ooh, we've been through this so many times
The end result's always the same
I always end up complaining
When I've got myself to blame

You'd think I'd learn to handle this by now
You're just a dead giveaway (dead giveaway)
Girl, you can't deny it (Even though you try), oh oh
You keep trying to hide it (Baby, we know why)

I get a call about 2 a.m
Saying you don't wanna be alone
I'm tired and half asleep
But emotions are just a little too strong
Oo, I figured that I'd call your bluff
'Cause you want me to come on by
Girl, you know it's your love I've always wanted
But this time I won't be denied

'Cause you're a dead giveaway, hey
You want me like I want you
You're just a dead giveaway (dead giveaway)

Girl, you can't deny it (even though you try), ooh ooh, baby
You keep trying to hide it (baby, we know why)

Well, now that you're serious
It's time to take off that disguise
You want more that mental stimulation
I can see it in your eyes
Oo, for years I've been your analyst
I've been as patient as I've been kind
For years you've played off believing
That I loved you for only your mind

You're just a dead giveaway
Girl, you want me like I want you
Dead giveaway

Dead giveaway
You've been holding back for too long
You're a dead giveaway (dead giveaway)

1186,Lawyers in Love,Jackson Browne,Jackson Browne,Lawyers in Love Jackson Browne,"I can't keep up with what's been going down
I think my heart must just be slowing down
Among the human beings
In their designer jeans
Am I the only one who hears the screams
And the strangled cries of lawyers in love

God sends his spaceships to America the beautiful
They land at six o'clock and there we are, the dutiful
Eating from TV trays
Tuned into Happy Days
Waiting for World War III while Jesus slaves
To the mating calls of lawyers in love

Last night I watched the news from Washington, the capital
The Russians escaped while we weren't watching them, like Russians will
Now we've got all this room
We've even got the moon
And I hear the USSR will be open soon
As vacation land for lawyers in love

Lawyers in love
Lawyers in love"
1187,What About Me,Moving Pictures,Moving Pictures,What About Me Moving Pictures,"Well, there's a little boy waiting
At the counter of the corner shop
He's been waiting down there, waiting half the day
They never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around, knocked to the ground
He gets to his feet and he says...

What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

Well, there's a pretty girl serving
At the counter of the corner shop
She's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream
Her dreams walk in and out; they never stop
Well she's not too proud, to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams...

What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

More than you give...

Take a step back and see the little people
They might be young
But they're the ones that make the big people big
So listen as they whisper:
""What about me?""

And now I'm standing on the corner
All the world's gone home
Nobody's changed, nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot
But sometimes I wish for more, than I've got...

What about me? It isn't fair
I don't have enough, now I want my share
Can't you see, I wanna live
But you just take more...

What about me? It isn't fair

What about...me?"

Take your seaside arms and write the next line

Would I recognize the face
Something's telling me it might be you

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to make
And with so much love to make
I think we're gonna meet some time
Maybe all we need is time...

And there's so much more

But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early Spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away

And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed
That Honey loved

And see the tree how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
And I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig"

Seems to me we got to solve it individually, ah ah
And I'll do unto you what you do to me
Said, no

Shout it from the mountain on out to the sea
No two ways about it, people have to be free (they gotta be free)
Ask me my opinion, my opinion will be
Natural situation for a man to be free
Get right on board now, huh, huh

Oh, what a feelin's just come over me
Love can move a mountain, make a blind man see
Everybody sing it now come on let's go see
Peace in the valley now, we all can be free

See that train over there?
Now that's the train of freedom
It's about to 'rrive any minute, now
You know it's been'a long, long overdue
Look out 'cause it's a'comin' right on through
Ha, ha, yeah"

1210,Harper Valley PTA,Jeannie C. Riley,Jeannie C.,Harper Valley PTA Jeannie C.,"I wanna tell you all the story bout the Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
And she said mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA

Well the note said Mrs.Johnson, you're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinkin' and a runnin' round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up your little girl this way
And it was signed by the Secretary, Harper Valley PTA

Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard I can still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there, and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down

Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA"

Gone away
With her went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you, it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
Because so badly I want to go outside
But everyone knows
That a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I got to cry because crying eases the pain
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside
Words could never explain
I just wish it would rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
(I just wish it would rain)
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
Because rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying
Crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears
I refuse to explain
Oh I wish it would rain
Let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Oh, let it rain
I'm a man and I got my pride
Till it rains I'm going to stay inside and let it rain"

West of Santa F√©

We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
Still I did what I had to do
'Cause I just knew

Summer: Sunday nights
We'd sink into our seats
Right as they dimmed out all the lights
A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
It called me to be on that screen
And live inside each scene

Could be brave or just insane

Or when my money's running low
The dusty mic and neon glow
Are all I need

(Tenement slum
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah)

You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In those eyes, I see reflected
A hurt, scorned, rejected

[Hook]
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

Started my life in an old, cold, rundown
Tenement slum (Tenement slum)
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

Ah, this love we're contemplating
Is worth the pain of waiting
We'll only end up hating
The child we may be creating

[Hook]
Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child (Scorned by) society
Love child, always second best (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Love child, different from the rest

(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby
(Hold on, hold on, just a little bit longer) Mmm, baby

I started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out (Somebody threw out)
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends would see the guilt in me

Ah, don't think that I don't need you
Don't think I don't wanna please you
But no child of mine will be bearing
The name of shame I've been wearing

[Hook]
Love child, love child, never quite as good (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Afraid, ashamed, misunderstood (Just a little bit longer, love child)
But I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)

I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
I'll always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
Always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)

You, you, you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
Always love you (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
You (Just a little bit longer, love child)
You (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)
I'll always love you (Just a little bit longer, love child)
Take a look, take a look at me (Wait, wait, won't you wait now, hold on)

Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no reason to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Then slowly turn away... from me

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow
If morning's echo says we've sinned
Well, it was what I wanted now
And if we're the victims of the night
I won't be blinded by light

Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Then slowly turn away...
I won't beg you to stay... with me...
Through the tears... of the day....
Of the years... baby, baby --

Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, Angel
Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby...."
1228,The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde,Georgie Fame,Georgie Fame,The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde Georgie Fame,"Bonnie and Clyde were pretty looking people
But I can tell you, people
They were the devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doing
One lazy afternoon
Down Savannah way

They robbed a store
And high-tailed out of that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited till the heat died down

Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation
Into the banking business
Reach for the sky!
Sweet talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars
In the dewlap bag

Now one brave man
He tried to take them alone
They left him lying in a pool of blood
And laughed about it all the way home

Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding from every American lawman's gun

They used to laugh about dying
But deep inside them they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lying
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun and the morning dew

Acting upon reliable information
A Federal Deputation laid a deadly ambush
When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them

Bonnie and Clyde
They lived a lot together
And finally together
They died"
1229,Those Were the Days,Mary Hopkin,Mary Hopkin,Those Were the Days Mary Hopkin,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
And dreamed of all the great things we would do

[Chorus]
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way
La la la la...

[Verse 2]
Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say

[Chorus]
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
La la la la...

[Verse 3]
Just tonight I stood before the tavern
Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me

[Chorus]
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
La la la la...

[Verse 4]
Through the door there came familiar laughter
I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh my friend we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same

[Chorus]
Those were the days my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
Those were the days, oh yes those were the days
La la la la..."

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine, tonight

Of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And then seal it with a kiss

The words could explain, but the words won't come
If you can see what you mean to me
My words should explain, but my words won't come

1253,Take Time to Know Her,Percy Sledge,Percy Sledge,Take Time to Know Her Percy Sledge,"I found a woman
I felt I truly loved
She was everything
I'd ever been dreaming of

But she was bad, I didn't know it
Her pretty smile never did show it
All I knew is what I could see
And I knew I wanted her for me

I took her home to mama
Mama wanted to see my future bride
Well she looked at us both
And then she called me to her side

She said, ""Son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Please don't rush into this thing""

But I didn't listen to mama
I went straight to the church
I just couldn't wait to have a little girl of mine
When I got off from work
The preacher was there
So was my future bride
He looked at us both
And then he called me to his side

He said, ""Son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
You better take time to know her
Please, please don't rush into this thing""

When it look like every thing was gonna turn out all right
And then I came home a little early one night
And there she was kissin' on another man

Now I know what mama meant when she took me by the hand
And said son, take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
Take time to know her
Please don't rush into this thing

Take time to know her
It's not an overnight fling
Take time to know her"

See your face come peeping through my window

Windows echo your reflection
When I look in their direction now
When will this haunting stop?
Your face it just won't leave me alone

So I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me

I could see, that girl was no good for me
But I was lost like a slave that no man could free

At break of day when that man drove away I was waiting
I crossed the street to her house and she opened the door
She stood there laughing
I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

My, my, my Delilah
Why, why, why Delilah
So before they come to break down the door
Forgive me Delilah I just couldn't take anymore

Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning around

Well on his way his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking percetly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

And there was more kinds of animals than you've ever seen
They'd run around free while the earth was being born
But the loveliest of them all was the Unicorn

There were green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn

Now God seen some sinning and it gave Him pain
And He says ""Stand back, I'm going to make it rain.""
He says ""Hey brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do
Build me a floating zoo. And take some of them...

Green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born
Don't you forget My Unicorn.""

Old Noah was there to answer the call
He finished up making the ark just as the rain started fallin
He marched in the animals two by two
And he called out as they went through, ""Hey Lord, I got your...""

Green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord I'm so forlorn
I just can't see no Unicorn.""

Then Noah looked out through the driving rain
Them Unicorns were hiding, playing silly games
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pouring
Oh them silly Unicorns

There were green alligators and long necked geese
Some humpy-back camels and some chimpanzees
Noah cried ""Close the door, cause the rain is pouring
And we just can't wait for no Unicorn.""

The ark started movin, it drifted with the tide
Them Unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away
And that's why you'll never seen a Unicorn... to this very day

You'll see green alligators and long necked geese

Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you're born

In the white room with black curtains near the station
Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

[Bridge]

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd;
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves

Some peace of mind in San Jose

Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you‚Äôre never alone
Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto

People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, He steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

Face down on the street with a gun in his hand

But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

[Verse 5]
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view

And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him

There's so much I wanna say to you
And there's so little time

Hey Little Woman please make up your mind
You've got to come into my world
And leave your world behind
Na, na, na, na...
You got to come down from that cloud girl and Leave your world behind

What do you see, when your walking down a busy street and I'm not there
Is my picture hanging in your mind
Walking with you there
That's how it is in my world girl
You're with me all the time
Why don't you come into my world and leave your world behind

Hey Little Woman please make up your mind
You've got to come into my world and leave your world behind
All right now.... Na, na, na, na...
You got to come down from that cloud girl and Leave your world behind"

The continent of Atlantis was an island
Which lay before the great flood
In the area we now call the Atlantic Ocean
So great an area of land
That from her western shores
Those beautiful sailors journeyed
To the South and the North Americas with ease
In their ships with painted sails
To the East Africa was a neighbor
Across a short strait of sea miles

The great Egyptian age is
But a remnant of The Atlantian culture
The antediluvian kings colonised the world
All the Gods who play in the mythological dramas
In all legends from all lands were from far Atlantis

Knowing her fate
Atlantis sent out ships to all corners of the Earth
On board were the Twelve:

The poet, the physician, The farmer, the scientist
The magician and the other so-called Gods of our legends
Though Gods they were -
And as the elders of our time choose to remain blind
Let us rejoice

And let us sing
And dance and ring in the new Hail Atlantis!

Make me change my mind
I would like to start all over again

Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
I just wanna change my mind

Oh, I played my games
Many times before
But, peoples, let me tell y'all
Oh, I never reached the door

But, ooh, the winds howl tonight
I keep looking back but
My baby's not in sight
I would like to start all over again

Baby, can I change my mind
Please, please, please, baby
Baby, let me change my mind"

He goes to work each day, and he stays all day long

He comes home each night looking tired and beat
He sits down at the dinner table and has a bite to eat

Never a frown always a smile
When he says to me how's my child
I said that I've been studying hard all day in school
Tryin' very hard to understand the golden rule

I think I'll color this man father
I think I'll color him love
Said I'm gonna color him father
I think I'll color the man love, yes I will

He says education is the thing if you want to compete
Because without it son, life ain't very sweet
I love this man and I don't know why
Except I'll need his strength until the day that I die

My mother loves him and I can tell
By the way she looks at him when he holds my little sister Nell
I heard her say just the other day
That if it hadn't of been for him she couldn't have found her way

I think I'll color him father
I'm gonna color him love
I've got to color him father
I think I'll color this man love

Our real old man he got killed in the war
And she knows she and seven kids couldn't of gotten very far
She said she thought that she could never love again
And then there he stood with that big wide grin
He married my mother and he took us in
And now we belong to the man with that big wide grin

I've got to color this man father
I'm gonna color him love
I've got to color him father
I believe I'll color this man love

He's just been so good to me
I know I've got to color him love
I'm gonna color him father
I've got to color this man love

He's just been so kind
I think I'll color him love
I'm gonna color him father"

If some of ya'll never been down south too much
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about this
So that you'll understand what I'm talkin' about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods
And in the fields looks somethin' like a turnip green
And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
Cause that's about all they had to eat, but they did all right

[Song]
Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame
Polk salad Annie, polk salad Annie
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A mean, vicious woman)

Every day 'for suppertime, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman)
(Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it)

Her daddy was lazy and no count, claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for was stealin' watermelons
Out of my truck patch
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

You know I need me a mess of it)"

But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore

I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise, I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that

Oh, and I'm just about to lose my mind

[Verse 2]
I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
Because you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love someone else
Instead

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah (heard it through the grapevine not much longer would you be my baby)

People say ""believe half of what you see
Son and none of what you hear""
But I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear:
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?
Don't you know

My life is so wasted, so wasted without you
I guess I love you much too much
Oh baby how can I face tomorrow
When yesterday is all I see
I just don't want to face tomorrow

Out of need, they seek direction for their life
They will love you in the darkness
Take advantage of your starkness
And refuse to recognize you in the light

Sweet cream ladies, forward march;
Think what you're providing
Sweet cream ladies, show your starch;
What's the use of hiding?
Tell the socialites to look the other way;
It's instinctive stimulation you convey
It's a necessary function
Meant for those without compunction

Who get tired of vanilla every day

Sweet cream ladies forward march;
Puritans ignore them
Sweet cream ladies do their part;
Sweet cream men adore them
Let them satisfy the ego of the male
Let them fabricate success to those who fail
And should penalties pursue them
When there's really credit due them
They might keep a simple fellow out of jail!

While I was thinkin' about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye

I was shakin' in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
Too see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

I'll see you when your clothes are on

Take you car, Yes we will

We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

The pages from my mind are stripped

And I can put you back down too

But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do

You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me

It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Suckin' on a chili dog outside the Tastee Freez
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap
He's got his hand between her knees
Jacky say, ""Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby Brooks slacks
Let me do what I please""
And Jacky say

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
They walk on

Jacky sits back, collects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
""Well then, there Diane, we ought to run off to the city""
Diane says, ""Baby, you ain't missin' nothing""
But Jacky say

Oh yeah, life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

Gonna let it rock
Let it roll
Let the Bible belt come and save my soul

1426,The Other Woman,Ray Parker Jr.,Ray Parker,The Other Woman Ray Parker,"Oh yeah
I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind

Aw shucks, I'm just the average guy
I fooled around a little on the side
Never thought it would amount to much
Never met a girl who's love was so tough
Who'd a thought a one night stand
Could turn into such a hot romance
Mm, when she did it to me
I slipped and fell in love

I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind

Now I know the rules of the games
You hit it once then break away clean
I should have never gone back, I know
But I had to have just a little bit more
My friends laugh but that's alright
I may be a fool but I know what I like
Now I hate to have to cheat
But it feels better when I sneak

I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind
Somebody help me
I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind

Oh this affair is unique
All my life I never met such a freak
She keeps me goin' strong for so long
When I get home it's all gone
Makes me wanna grab my guitar
And play with it all night long

I'm in love with the other woman
My life was fine (Yes it was)
Till she blew my mind

Tell me, has anybody else out there
Ever fell in love with the other woman
Oh with the other woman
Say I'm in love with the other woman
With the other woman, with the other woman
I'm in love, sure 'nough in love"

I remember
When you used to be
The talk of the town
All you get is lonely

Turn your love around
Don't you turn me down
I can show you how

But I need the girl to stay

All away
When the woman needs
A taste of yesterday

Oh, girl you know me
I'm alone until you show me
That you're still in love with me

You're gonna take it
Back where we belong

Don't you turn me down
I can show you how

You just need someone near

I'll spend thinking of you when you're not here

How many times will I think about the things
I'd like to do?
Always denied the right to live my life the way
I want, I want to share it with you

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by
And I'll write the words you love
But what I can't say in a letter
Will just have to wait till I get home

There's not much time to tell you
Half the things that I should
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you
And I'd do it again if I could

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

Sleep like a child resting deep
You don't know what you give me
I keep for these moments, whoa, oh oh oh ooh

Close your eyes
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams
Close your eyes
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams

We kiss altogether wrong
No intention

We lied about each other's drinks
We lived without each other thinking
What anyone would do
Without me and you

It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play

So hold on, here we go
Hold on to nothing we know
I feel so lonely
Way up here

You mention the time we were together
So long ago
Well, I don't remember
All I know is that it makes me feel good now

It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play

Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play
It's like I told you

Go 'way, don't come 'round here no more
Can't you see that it's late at night?
I'm very tired, and I'm not feeling right
All I wish is to be alone;
Stay away, don't you invade my home
Best off if you hang outside
Don't come in, I'll only run and hide

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Who can it be knocking at my door?
Make no sound, tip-toe across the floor
If he hears, he'll knock all day
I'll be trapped, and here I'll have to stay
I've done no harm, I keep to myself;
There's nothing wrong with my state of mental health
I like it here with my childhood friend;
Here they come, those feelings again!

Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?
Who can it be now?

Is it the man come to take me away?
Why do they follow me?

It's just my fantasy

Don't cry cause I ain't changing my mind
So find another fool like before
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing

We drifted apart
And here you are
By my side

Believe what I say
So here I am

1435,Leader of the Band,Dan Fogelberg,Dan Fogelberg,Leader of the Band Dan Fogelberg,"An only child
Alone and wild
A cabinet maker`s son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none

He left his home
And went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift
I know I never can repay

A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once
But his music wouldn`t wait

He earned his love through discipline
A thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means
Of sculpting souls
Took me years to understand

The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs
Through my instrument
And his song is in my soul

My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I`m just a living legacy
To the leader of the band

My brothers' lives were different
For they heard another call
One went to Chicago
And the other to St. Paul

And I'm in Colorado
When I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I`ve chose
And come to know so well

I thank you for the music
And your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom
When it came my time to go

I thank you for the kindness
And the times when you got tough
And, papa
I don`t think I said
I love you near enough

The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs
Through my instrument
And his song is in my soul

My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I`m just a living legacy
To the leader of the band

I am the living legacy
To the leader of the band"

Shatter with words impossible to follow

I search only for something I can't see
I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know

When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave

Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
And sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by

The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

Ooohooo, I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun

But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Please, lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today

I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives

Oh, I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed 'em what I've got

I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to see
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places as we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet

I've spent my life exploring, the subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free, hey, lady
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

I've been to paradise
Never been to me

I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I've been to paradise
Never been to me

Been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I've sipped champange on a yacht
I've been to paradise
Never been to to me"

A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance?
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And now you find yourself in Eighty Two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

Cause it's the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambitions you remember well

It was the heat of the moment

The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

Somethings sometimes do

And now I'm feeling strong enough to let you in

Billy left his home with a dollar in his pocket
And a head full of dreams
He said somehow, someway
It's gotta get better than this

Patti packed her bags
Left a note for her mama
She was just seventeen
There were tears in her eyes
When she kissed her little sister goodbye

They held each other tight
As they drove on through the night
They were so excited
We got just one shot of life
Let's take it while we're still not afraid

Because life is so brief
And time is a thief, when you're undecided
And like a fistful of sand
It can slip right through your hands

Young hearts be free tonight
Time is on your side
Don't let them put you down
Don't let 'em push you around
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view

Paradise was closed
So they headed for the coast in a blissful manner
They took a tworoom apartment
That was jumping every night of the week

Happiness was found in each other's arms
As expected, yeah

Drove a pickup, like a lunatic sing, ooh!

When there's nobody listening
So we just ran away
Patti gave birth to a ten-pound baby boy, yeah!

Slow-motion weekdays stare me down
Her lipstick reflex got me wound
There were no defects to be found

Test-strip proof-sheet love is hard to find
Friday night we'll dance the spotlight grind
Stop-time heart for me if she's not mine

A place I didn't want to be

But you came and I was so tempted
To gamble on love just one time
I never thought that I would get caught
It seemed like a perfect crime

But I've only got one plea
Lock me away inside of your love
And throw away the key
I'm guilty, of love in the first degree

Like a thousand times before
I'd take what I wanted and just walk away
But I never made it to the door

Go ahead and throw the book at me
If loving you's a crime
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be

Lock me away inside of your love

Ask her to stay

And he thinks he's got just what he needs

Driving him down to his knees
Make him start giving

Living again

That tricks you into leaving everytime
Love will turn you around, turn you around
Well, it's your heart
That talks you into staying where you are
Love will turn you around
Turn you around

Out of the blue
She reaches for you
And you tell her you don't have the time
So you move away fast
But you know it won't last
Cause you can't get her off of your mind
Thoughts are burning
Turning
They're turning around

How do you know when to stay or to go
And how do you know when it's real
You don't need a sign to make up your mind
You got your heart at the wheel

You wanna start sharing
Caring
Caring again

Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere

A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night

Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlights people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win, some will lose

The last time I cried
I was holding you and loving you
Knowing it would end

I never felt so good
Yet felt so bad
You're the one I love
And what makes it sad
Is you don't belong to me

And I can remember
The last time I lied
I was holding you and telling you
We could still be friends

Tried to let you go
But I can't, you know
And even though I'm not with you
I need you so
But you don't belong to me

Chorus:
Comin' in and out of your life
Isn't easy
When there are so many nights
I can't hold you and I've told you
These feelings are so hard to find
Comin' in and out of your life
Will never free me
'cause I don't need to touch you
To feel you, it's so real with you

I just can't get you out of my mind
But I can remember the last time we tried
Each needing more than we could give
And knowing all the time
A stronger love
Just can't be found
Even though at times this crazy world
Is turning up-side-down
You'll always belong to me

I think you're headed for a breakdown, so be careful not to show it

You really don't remember, was it something that he said?
Are the voices in your head calling, Gloria?
Gloria, don't you think you're fallin'?
If everybody wants you, why isn't anybody callin'?

1476,Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny),Elton John,Elton John,Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny) Elton John,"[Verse 1]
What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain
And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one no one can replace

[Chorus]
And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

[Verse 2]
And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear
Who lived there
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

[Chorus][x2]

Oh hey hey Johnny,can you come out
Johnny can't you come out to play in your empty garden [6x]"

So there's no sense pretending

And just when I thought I could stand on my own

And I just can't go on without you

I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain

The line of the sea, seceding the coast?
Fine capillaries, glowing with cars?
The comfort you drew from the light of the stars?

And how long did you climb that night
With the ice in your lungs, on the rungs of the light?
Beyond recall, you severed all strings
To everyone, and everything

Oh, silent, constant driver of mine
Wordlessly calling from the end of the line
Where even though each hour I ever loved
Must queue and dive
Still, you will not take my heart alive
You will not take my heart alive
You will not take my heart alive
You will not take my heart

In martial wind, and in clarion rain
We minced into battle, wincing in pain;
Not meant for walking, backs bound in twine:
Not angel or devil
But level, in time

And I rose, to take my shape at last
From the dreams that had dogged me, through every past
When to my soul the body would say:
You may do what you like
As long as you stay

Now the towns and forests, highways and plains
Fall back in circles like an emptying drain
And I won't come round this way again
Where the lonely wind abides
And you will not take my heart, alive
You will not take my heart alive [x6]
You will not take my heart"

You said you had the answers to it all
You never told me I'd take a fall

You
You turned my life
Into a paperback novel
Words that come to life
Inside your little melodrama

Chapter one
When I was young
I came to you with my problems
Chapter two
You promised me love
And anything that I desired

Tell me

Thought you said
You had the answers to it all
Never told me
I was gonna take a fall
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall

You have nailed my heart
Upon the wall for your pleasures
You have cast a spell
That cannot ever be broken

And now
My eyes grow tired
I watch my picture getting older
But I
Remain the same
Trapped in this mirror forever

Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answers to it all
You never told me
I was gonna take a fall
Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall

I talk to you each night
And I follow your advise
You've been wrong
What's the price I have to pay
For this fairy tale thing called love?
Let me go!

Tell me
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Thought you said
You had the answers to it all
Never told me I was gonna take a fall
Tell me

Love boat set itself free
Castaway, slipping out to sea

I can feel it coming adrift
Even a blind man could see the rift
From an ocean liner
To a Chinese junk
There ain't been a ship that can't be sunk

I used to dream it could last forever
But pipe dreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never
Thought something like this
Couldn't happen to you

You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

You don't know
Just what you got
Till it's gone
I guess you heard that a lot
But it's true
It's not just a game
You can't change your life
By changing your name

It's not something you can hide away
Sooner or later it starts to show
It's written on your face
You've been betrayed
Do you really believe that I don't know

You've got a man on your mind
You've got a weight on your shoulders

So it's no use to fight
And if he starts callin'
Let him know you're with me

Throwing love away and losing their minds

Maybe it's me who's gone crazy, but I can't understand why
All these lovers keep hurting each other
When good love is so hard to come by

So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me what's forever For?

When right there in their hands is a dying romance
And they're not even trying to keep it alive

It ain't the latest thing
I'm just standing in a doorway
I'm just trying to make some sense

Out of these girls go passing by
The tales they tell of men
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend

A smile relieves a heart that grieves
Remember what I said
I'm not waiting on a lady
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend
Just waiting on a friend

Don't need a whore
I don't need no booze
Don't need a virgin priest
But I need someone I can cry to
I need someone to protect

I'm just waiting on a friend
I'm just waiting on a friend

Just waiting on a friend...

I need you more and more

Through the years, through all the good and bad
I knew how much we had, I've always been so glad
To be with you ... through the years
It's better every day, you've kissed my tears away
As long as it's okay, I'll stay with you
Through the years

Through the years, when everything went wrong
Together we were strong, I know that I belonged
Right here with you ... through the years
I never had a doubt, we'd always work things out
I've learned what love's about, by loving you
Through the years

Through the years, you've never let me down
You've turned my life around, the sweetest days I've found

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day (one sweet day)
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (yes, we will)

1503,Because You Loved Me,Celine Dion,Celine Dion,Because You Loved Me Celine Dion,"[Verse 1]
For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I would be forever thankful baby
You are the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You are the one who saw me through through it all

[Chorus]
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I could not reach
You gave me faith because you believed
I am everything I am
Because you loved me

[Verse 2]
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love I had it all
I am grateful for each day you gave me
Maybe I do not know that much
But I know this much is true
I was blessed because I was loved by you

[Chorus]
You were my strength when I was weak
(You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I could not reach
You gave me faith because you believed
I am everything I am
Because you loved me

[Verse 3]
You were always there for me
The tender wind that carried me
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You have been my inspiration
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you

[Chorus]
You were my strength when I was weak
(You were my strength)
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
(When I couldn't speak)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I could not reach
You gave me faith because you believed
I am everything I am
Because you loved me
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn't speak
(My voice)
You were my eyes when I couldn't see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I could not reach
You gave me faith because you believed
I am everything I am
Because you loved me

1504,Nobody Knows,The Tony Rich Project,The Tony,Nobody Knows The Tony,"Yeah, wish I told her how I felt
Maybe she'd be here right now
But instead...

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closin' more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say
The things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly
But you're nowhere around

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside and nobody knows it but me
I lie awake it's a quarter past three
I'm screamin' at night as if I thought
You'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know
I'll be lovin' you still

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me

Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart and hope you come back to me
Said when the nights are lonely...

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you
And nobody knows it but me"

'Cause it's gonna come for you

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Dead souls, nigga, this for Wally
Eazy, C's Uncle Charlie
Little Boo, but God's got him
And I'm gonna miss everybody
I done rolled with blows like AIDS
Looked at him while he laid and prayed
But destiny played too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me
Told me if he should decease, ""well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me.""

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won‚Äôt budge
Grudge, because there‚Äôs no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what could I do?
It's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our souls, hey-o-ayo

Now follow me, roll stroll
Whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit to the people that's long gone, they rest: Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
And still keepin' up with they family
Exactly how many days we got lastin'?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away
God, rest our souls
'Cause I know I might meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs, baby

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Lil E-Z long gone
Really wish he could come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go, bye bye
All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dog?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all
And he shouldn't be gone
In front of his home, what they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, was so wrong
Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on, lean on

Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

Those days of warm rains come rushing back to me
Miles of windless summer night air
Secret moments shared in the heat of the afternoon
Out of the stillness, soft spoken words
Say, say it again

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

You've got the most unbelievable blue eyes I've ever seen
You've got me almost melting away
As we lay there under a blue sky with pure white stars
Exotic sweetness, a magical time
Say, say it again

I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you
I love you always forever
Near and far, closer together
Everywhere I will be with you
Everything I will do for you

Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever
Near and far and always and everywhere and everything
Say you'll love, love me forever
Never stop, never whatever

I step off the train
I'm walking down your street again
And past your door
But you don't live there anymore
It's years since you've been there
Now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

[Chorus]
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

[Verse 2]
Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead
Of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me
Where I always used to be

[Chorus]
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

[Verse 3]
Back on the train
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess
I've been hanging around your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on

[Chorus]
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

I step off the train

You've found some better place

An old man turned 98
He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

Isn't it ironic
Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
Who would've thought - it figures!

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down he thought, ""Well isn't this nice""

And isn't it ironic
Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong
And everything blows up in your face

[Verse 3]
It's a traffic jam when you're already late
It's a no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife

[Pre-Chorus]
And isn't it ironic
Don't you think?
A little too ironic
Yeah, I really do think

Running out on luck
Take me to the church and back again
Without tripping up
Search the wild until I'm found again
If you had enough
Lose me to the fire of Damian
I can't get enough
And I'm not gonna hide
So many reasons why you're better off
You've seen the madness
Blind to right or wrong
I tried to put my brakes on, but I'm already lost
Lost to the madness
Cause when I inhale, exhale
I'm back again

Glass empty or full
Quench my thirsty tongue, I'm drinking it
Master of my school
Break the rules until I'm making them
It's me, it's not you
And I can't get enough

I'm not gonna lie
It's your decision
I'm already lost
Don't try to reason

There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

[Chorus]
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that

It's all coming back to me

And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago

There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago

This is more than a crush

It was Harlem at the Ruckers
I saw with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him 5 months (that's right)
Besides he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Cathchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years

I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unities our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control
But it's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

Did you get to be a star?

On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars, skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions like children often do

[Chorus]
We said, tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far, am I very far now?

[Verse 3]
It's getting cold picked up the pace
How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained
We pass many cross-eyed people
And ask many questions like children often do

[Chorus]
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far
Am I very far now, am I very far now, am I very far now?
Tell me all your thoughts on God"

Doctors have come from distant cities
Just to see me
Stand over my bed
Disbelieving what they're seeing
They say I must be one of the wonders
Of God's own creation
And as far as they can see they can offer
No explanation
Newspapers ask intimate questions
Want confessions
They reach into my head
To steal the glory of my story
They say I must be one of the wonders
Of god's own creation
And as far as they can see they can offer
No explanation

Oh, I believe

Laughed as she came to my cradle
Know this child will be able
Laughed as my body she lifted
Know this child will be gifted
With love, with patience and with faith
She'll make her way

People see me
I'm a challenge to your balance
I'm over your heads
How I confound you and astound you
To know I must be one of the wonders

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‚ÄòCause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies are down, so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now but will I live to see 24?
The way things is going I don't know

That the ones we hurt are you and me?

I'll give you love
The things you want
Ohhh... Ahh...
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you...

[Verse 1]
Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I can hold you tight
Pain in my heart because I'm all alone
Why did you leave
Why did your love have to gooo
And I would do anything for you
I would
Thinking of ways that I could win your heart
But I'm so confused, I don't know where to start
Visions of love forever in my mind
I wait for the day when I can say that love's mine
'Cause I would do anything for you
Yes, I would

I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you

So what can I do to prove I need your love
What will it take because I won't give up
Open your heart and let your feelings show
'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you gooo
Girl, I would do anything for you
Yes, I would

[Chorus]
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

So if there ever comes a time
When it's true love you hope to find
Just call out my name
And girl, that's when I would do anything

(I'll give you love oh, I'll give you love girl)
I would do anything for you

On a Sunday afternoon
You were there, so was I
In the park, 4th of July

When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season

What'nt gone be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly conversation
Had no time for new relation-ships

I must admit to you, when I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am

Oh why do I feel the way I do?
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line, that made me fall for you
Do you know, why I'm diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you?

It's on like that

Cause tomorrow's just another day

Dying for the color of a rag
Time, take their red and blue
Wash them in the ocean, make them clean
Maybe their mothers won't cry tonight

Macked out with my dreads and my Kangol
Forget the Moet, nigga, just pass the Cisco
Yo, take a trip down to Mexico
Come back with that shit that might make you psycho
Maximum frequencies through your stereo
Sorry this is it but homeboy I got to go

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
When I step up in the place, a-yo I step correct
Woo-hah, got you all in check
I got that head nod shit that make you break your neck
Woo-hah, got you all in check
And you know we come through to wreck the discotheque
Woo-hah, got you all in check
Throw your hands up in the air, don't ever disrespect
Woo-hah, got you all in check"

I've been doing my own thing
Love has always had a way of having bad timing
But to my great surprise, ever since I looked in your eyes
I had one question for you

[Chorus 1]
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
Wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to

[Verse 2]
If you've thought I'd sleep on this
Boy, you're wrong cause all I dream about is our first kiss
And you're the first one to make me feel like this
And this is one opportunity that I can't miss, no, no
Boy, you wanna know the deal
You are wondering if the words I'm saying are for real
'Cause you got more appeal than any man in this whole world
And baby, I got to know how you feel, yeah

[Chorus 1]
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
Wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to

Sweetheart, now it's time I let you know
I don't wanna rush, we should take it slow
Boy, I can love you, can you help me grow
Give me a new beginning and I'll give you a happy ending

[Chorus 2 (until fade)]
Tell me if you want me to
I wanna make it good for you
I promise, girl, that I'll be true

One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs
This shit here must stop, like ""Freeze!""
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's
And that's a no-no

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me, I'm out this bitch

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls, before them blunts got crunk, chunky asses
Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's
And they looking like Halle Berry's
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma I want to sing
But momma I want to trick, and momma I'm sucking dick now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82, me and you like Tony Toni Tone

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey man, you remember me from school?"" ""No not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat
Like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat
So we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

It doesn't matter what I say
So long as I sing with inflection
That makes you feel I'll convey
Some inner truth or vast reflection
But I've said nothing so far
And I can keep it up for as long as it takes
And it don't matter who you are
If I'm doing my job, it's your resolve that breaks

[Hook]
Because the Hook brings you back
I ain't tellin' you no lie
The Hook brings you back
On that you can rely

[Verse 2]
There is something amiss
I am being insincere
In fact I don't mean any of this
Still my confession draws you near
To confuse the issue I'll refer
To familiar heroes from long ago
No matter how much Peter loved her
What made the Pan refuse to grow

[Hook]
Was that the hook that brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie
The hook brings you back
On that you can rely

[Verse 3]
Suck it in, suck it in, suck it in
If you're Rin Tin Tin or Anne Boleyn
Make a desperate move or else you'll win
And then begin to see what you're doing to me
This MTV is not for free
It's so PC it's killing me
So, desperately, I sing to thee of love
Sure, but also of rage and hate and pain and fear of self
And I can't keep these feelings on the shelf
I've tried -- well no in fact I lied
Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside
To hide or slide I'll do as I'll decide
And let it ride until I've died
And only then shall I abide this tide
Of catchy little tunes
Of hip three minute ditties
I wanna bust all your balloons
I wanna burn all of your cities to the ground
I've found I will not mess around
Unless I play, then hey, I will go on all day
Hear what I say, I have a prayer to pray
That's really all this was
And when I'm feeling stuck and need a buck
I don't rely on luck because

[Hook]
The hook brings you back
I ain't telling you no lie
The hook
On that you can rely"

But I saw you first, I'm the first one tonight
Yes, I saw you first, don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart
Everyone was lookin'

In the bone-colored dawn, me and Gypsy Scotty are singin'
The radio is playin', she left her shoes out in the back
He tells me a story about some girl he knows in Kentucky
He just made that story up, there ain't no girl like that

But I saw you first, I'm the first one tonight
Yes, I saw you first, don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart
Everyone was lookin' but I saw you first
I saw you first
I saw you first
Yeah, yeah"

He rides the river every day
I sit on the bank and I holler when he passes
""Hey, old man, are they biting today?""

I wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout my troubles
I go down to the water and they pass away
And when the old man comes a-floating down the river
""Hey, old man, are they biting today?""

Now here we've got a thing that keeps on rolling
It ain't heavy, don't take it that way
The old man and me, we got a good thing going

I've been long, a long way from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And drank til I was thirsty again
We went searching through thrift store jungles
Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, O.K. I made this up
I promised you I'd never give up

[Chorus]
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

[Verse 2]
You get down, real low down
You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train
Well who hasn't been there before?
I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, O.K. I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

[Chorus]
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad
If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad
If it makes you happy
Then why the hell are you so sad

We've been far, far away from here
Put on a poncho, played for mosquitos
And everywhere in between

Well, O.K. we get along
So what if right now everything's wrong?

If it makes you happy
It can't be that bad

It felt like springtime
On this February morning
In a courtyard
Birds were singing your praise

I'm still recalling things you said
To make me feel all right
I carry them with me today now

[Chorus:]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear

Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy

[Verse 2:]
I wonder why I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy hearted
Til you call my name

And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I went to meet you barefoot
Barely breathing

[Repeat Chorus:]

Oh, darling

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
It`s not too near for me
Like a flower
I need the rain

Thought it`s not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

Mmm, the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again

When the sun comes out
Oh, the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out"

B-boy where the fuck you at
I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
You're getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vexed and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body
Who's body, your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boots
Now let me take sight while your loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right

[Hook]
Keep on, keeping on cause you came and you changed my world
Your love so brand new, keep on keep keeping on
Doin it right, right, right

[Verse 2]
Beware of the stare when I step into peace
I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released
Now who from the chosen shall I choose
Yeah now you wish you was in his shoes
I found me a new nigga this year
That knows how to handle this here
Now I look forward to going home at night
Brother does me right under the candlelight
Wax upon my back can I handle all of that
I guess I can, can I why not
If I wanna guess I can, can I
More honey than a bumble-bee hive
Pulling sixty-nine ways in my archive
Sweet like licorice, sugar for my booga
Juicy like Hi-C or an Icee
I got shit to make your ass write a bad check
Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat
Beat on my drum if you feel the need to
As I procede to open up and feed you
I got a longing to put you where you wanna be
Been I can, I get rid of all company

[Hook]

Many have tried strict regulations
Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation
Those that didn't perform well
They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell
You're playing with my time
Trying to jerk me, hurt me then dessert me
You better work me while you got the oppurtunity
To be in the midst of the L-Y-T-E
Only the strong survive, only the wise excel
Once said by my born-in-hell
Only the lonely die slowly
Left all alone try to control me
Easy does it never ask how was it
Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets
Cause that ain't cool and that ain't cute
To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot
But it's all good though, you gotta get it when you want it
Sight your prey, make your move and hop up on it
It's natural, never be ashamed
Fuck the fame, get the name and kick the game

Oh, oh...
Ooh, ooh...
Oh, yeah...
Oh, oh...

Last night, I slept alone - I stayed at home
For the first time since you've been gone, baby...
No friends to understand, to lend a helping hand
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known...

How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me;
Don't you remember that you promised me? Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy...
But you went away, baby, and it's such a shame;
How could you turn your back on me? Oh...

(If you really don't want me,) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me,) If you don't need me...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?) Tell me who do you love, boy?
(If you really don't want me,) If you don't want me... (if you really don't need me,) If you don't need me...
(If you really don't love me, then who do you love?)

I gave, gave everything a man could ever need;
I was there whenever you would call me, baby...
But somehow, your feelings changed, you don't act the same;
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all...

How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me;
Don't you remember that you promised me? Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy...
Now the love is gone, baby - tell me what went wrong?
How could you leave me hanging on? Oh, baby...

That I'm not the one who can fill your every need... (Fill your need...)
I painted a picture so clear, it's reality; (Reality...)
Now I know, yes, I know, that you're not the one for me...

You wanna sip Mo' on my living room flo'

Sex all night, mad head in the morn'
Spin my V, smoke all my weed
Tattoo on titty saying ""B-I-G"", now check it
You wanna be my main squeeze, baby
Don'tcha? You want to give me what I need, baby
Won'tcha picture life as my wife? Just think
Full-length mink, fat X and O links
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
Shit got hot: you sent Feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got
Another intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her
""Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?""
My Moschino hoe, my Versace hottie
Come to find out you was fucking everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C
Woe! Oh is me - that's what I get for trickin'
Pay my own bail, commence to ass-kickin'
Kick in the door, waving the .44
All you heard was ""Poppa don't hit me no more!""
Disrespect my clique, my shit's imperial
Fuck around and made her milk box material
You feel me? Sucking dick, running your lips
Cause of you, I'm on some real ""fuck-a-bitch"" shit

Whoo, I told you niggas
Niggas.. better grab a seat
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch 6 feet
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard bound, niggas press to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinking I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killing than the stick-up jukes
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cumming down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze, nigga
Don'tcha? You wanna lick between my knees, nigga
Don'tcha want to see me whippin' your 3 down the Ave
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air
You get vexed and start swinging everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me
Pull out your 9 while I cock on mine
Yeah, what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what, nigga? I'm not trying to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vittadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things that make up for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards saying ""I apologize""
Is you with me? How could you ever deceive me?
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me
Nah, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo flow

In the backseat of a Caddy?
Chop it up with Do or Die

[Verse 1: AK-47]
It was seven double-oh P.M
Fly low to them hoes in the B-M
Sipping Seagram, chewing on a weed stem
Touching on my fo' fif
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three-line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And, plus, we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
Cause I forgot where I met the ho
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the ho, really doe
To the crib

[Hook x2: Johnny P]

[Verse 2: AK-47, Belo]
Seven deuce five, I ride the point to spot the live hoes
Three miles per hour
Like we running up on some rivals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly, 'Lo
Introduce myself
A-to-the-motherfucking-K, better recognize
Then I loose myself, juice myself
As you take one pull, uh, pass it to the left and um
Self-centered niggas'll take two pulls cause they thinking about self and um
P-I, M-P, -ology, but logically
We learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

[Belo]
Mmm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the C-A
D-I, double-L, pumping A-C, A see hoes
They peep those, P-I, M-P, and they think that automatically
Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
Cause nigga be sporting nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels, Girbaud, flexing one five oh
Chop up that paper, ho, chop up that paper, ho
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fucking with a pimp, doe
Get involved in the backseat
That's how it be in the Cad when you messing with them young lads
Smoking on that finest grass
Never miss what you never had, at last
P-I, M-P, -ology, but logically
We learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

Verse 3: Tung Twista
Well, a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spitting mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the open lips and the provoking hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
I been looking in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo anatomy gotta be right
That'd be to flatter me, right
But if the head the bomb, c'mon, suck a nigga dick
Members of my clique wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try that, to the rhythm of a hi-hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a ho to let my fellas run a train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your ho
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me, trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another B, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room, she rubbing me with lotion
Coming like an ocean, coasting, have her sick
Thinking me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word no was never said
Twista be giving women dick in the bed, until they sick in the head
And if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the feds or spitting game, but it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a playa do
Then belittle in a day or two
After words I'mma slay a crew
Now that's some pimp-type shit that Belo and AK'll do
Wearing gray and blue
If a ho wanna holler, then you a playa if you hit them ends
And get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same ho to wanna freak your friends

Be learning these hoes biology, obviously, well

Sittin on a quarter P of hay, thangs is feelin good today
I'm tore up, from the floor up, sippin on some Crown Royal
Trippin, in a circle of wood where everybody smoke they own bud
Good ole' hay, how you feel today? Fine, blowed and dandy
Silly like I'm hype off candy, gotta big, thick chick named sandy
In the farm in the middle of the barn where everybody's feelin crazy
I went to visit granny's house, now I see why don't nobody leave
We constantly, constantly, constantly smokin B's
Too blitzed to even shake it off, but I still got my head up
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn and get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut, blaze it up so I can hit that bud
Get me zoned and i'll be on cause I love to smoke upon hay

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wildstyle]
The hay got me goin through a stage and I just can't get enough
Smokin everyday, I got some hay and you know I'm finna roll it up
Make a cloud, I'm gonna take my mind away from all the bullcrap
Bump my sounds, lay back and roll, mack to the freaks that's on the road
Sometimes I wonder when I was blowed on the streets
Anybody wanna step to me, I'mma see how rough they be
In this session, manifesting on my P's and Q's, never snooze cause I refuse
Inhale, exhale the smell, smokin hay all by myself
Wildstyle, laughin loud, wit my homies by my side
If somethin jump off let it ride, on my square when time is live
Everybody throw it up, go to the barn and get some hay
When I get my choke on, fool you know I'm smokin on......

[Verse 3]
Hay now hay, we smokin up hay in the middle of the barn
And I'm lit up, can't get up, my eyes are red and my head is spinnin
Took another pull, ridin red bull, got the goofies, can't stop grinnin
Got a posse full of hoes playin in my braids and we bout to get in em
Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at and everything funny
Gotta pause some nigga tryna blow my high smokin all that hay with no money
Now truly this bitch wanna do me, so I hit the 151 Bacardi
She high like the sun, thick like cornbread and I'm ready to party
That hay got me so gotdamn horny but I don't like that tramp
The only reason I'm poppin that coochie cause the ho had a book of foodstamps
And I got the munchies, I need soul food, collard greens or pinto beans
If you smoke hay like the conflict do, then you know what the hell I mean

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Rollin down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat door crack
Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin herb so creep up on the wall and all I heard
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in the hay with a funky dime word
Couldn't be myself, couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If I didn't pass it to the left, nigga would have lost my breath
Open up the window 'fore I fall and faint but I can't cause I roll around in dat barn ride
Rollin up the hootie hoo, roughest skin roller on dat west side
Nigga come on in, I got some hay, won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for? Ain't nobody to rich, we poor
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn, the flies keep us chokin
Thank you Jesus Christ for all the hay you're givin us cause we'll keep on smokin'

We come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why
I'm such a baby cause the Dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me
You've got nothing left to say
I'll only pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance
You won't sing
I just want to love you but you want to wear my ring

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan
Sitting on a fence
I say that line is great
You ask me what it meant by
Said I shot a man named Gray
Took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky

I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool
I only wanna be with you

Yeah I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

If it will ever end
You get so mad at me
When I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy
And you wonder why

Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money.""

""Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental.""

Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
""You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers.""

That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose"

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico

Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten
Gonna ride like the wind

And I've got such a long way to go
To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind
Ride like the wind

Accused and tried and told to hang
I was nowhere in sight when the church bells rang
Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

It is the night

To be free again

And I'm without you once again
You laughed at me
You said you never needed me
I wonder if you need me now

We played the games that people play
We made mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
Remembering the pain if I must say
It's deep in my mind and locked away
But then most of all
I do love you
Still

Those memories
Times I'm sure we'll never forget
Those feelings we can't put aside
For what we had
Sometimes I try to understand
But it's so heavy on my mind

So many dreams that flow away
So many words we didn't say
Two people lost in a storm
Where did we go?
Where'd we go?

Lost what we both had found
You know we let each other down
But then most of all
I do love You
Still

We played the games that people play
We made our mistakes along the way
Somehow I know deep in my heart
You needed me
'Cause I needed you so desperately!
We were too blind to see
But then most of all
I do love You

Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes

I got up and took your hand and we both began to dance to the music
Ooh your magic cast a spell, it didn't take long 'til we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be

The coward of the county
He'd never stood one single time
To prove the county wrong
His mama named him Tommy
But folks just called him yellow
Something always told me
They were reading Tommy wrong

He was only ten years old
When his daddy died in prison
I looked after Tommy
Cause he was my brother's son
I still recall the final words
My brother said to Tommy
Son my life is over
But yours has just begun

Promise me, son
Not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

There's someone for everyone
And Tommy's love was Becky
In her arms he didn't have
To prove he was a man
One day while he was working
The Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky
N'there was three of them
Tommy opened up the door
And saw Becky crying
The torn dress, the shattered look
Was more than he could stand
He reached above the fireplace
Took down his daddy's picture
As his tears fell on his daddy's face
I heard these words again

Promise me, son
Not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can
Now it don't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek
And I hope you're old enough to understand
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the barroom
One of them got up
And met him half way cross the floor
Tommy turned around they said
Hey look, old yeller's leavin'
You could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door

Twenty years of crawling
Was bottled up inside him
He wasn't holding nothing back
He let 'em have it all
Tommy left the bar room
Not a Gatlin boy was standing
He said, This one's for Becky
As he watched the last one fall
N' I heard him say

I promised you, Dad
Not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak
I didn't turn the other cheek
Papa, I should hope you understand
Sometimes you gotta fight
When you're a man

The coward of the county"

At seventeen we fell in love
High school sweethearts, love was so brand new
We took the vows of man and wife
Forever, for life

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember how we made our way
A little patience, the time we pray
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl, when you lose

[Chorus]
Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
We gotta cool this anger
What a mess we've made
So long ago
You were my love, oh my love

[Verse 2]
Flyin' high we never took the time
To stop and feel the need
Funny how those years go by
Changing you, changing me

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember love's fever
In our hearts, girl and in our minds
Can't imagine that this love is through
Feelin' the pain, girl, when you lose

[Chorus]
Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
What a mess we've made
So long ago
You were my love
Feeling
The pain

From this mess that we've made
Oh it's too hot (too hot)
Too hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta run for shelter
Gotta run for shade
It's too hot (too hot)
So, so hot, lady (too hot)
Gotta cool this anger
Oh, gotta cool this mess we've made
It's so, so hot, baby (too hot)
Yes it's so hot (too hot)

We were once lovers (too hot)
We took our vows (too hot)
A man and wife
Forever
Oh (too hot)

Baby (too hot)
Please won't you listen (too hot)
It hurt me so bad
But I know I've got to leave

I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

[Verse 2]
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

[Bridge]
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

[Chorus 3]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time"

A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back

Look in the mirror tell me do you think your life's in danger here, yeah

I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

[Verse 3]
So now that it's over can't we just say good-bye?
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way

I never wanted it to end this way, my love, my darling

This is no fiction this is no act

Each day I'll be living to
Make sure I'm giving you

More love and more joy

But it was long ago
Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in darkness with the radio playin' low

And the secrets that we shared
Mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

The years rolled slowly past
And I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I

Guess I lost my way
There were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and running to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe

Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

Against the wind

1652,On the Radio,Donna Summer,Donna Summer,On the Radio Donna Summer,"Someone found a letter you wrote me on the radio
And they told the world just how you felt
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat
They never said your name
But I knew just who they meant

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too
If, by chance, you heard it for yourself
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Now, now, don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song?
Things are not the same since we broke up last June
The only thing that I wanna hear is that you love me still
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah, it kinda made me feel proud when I heard him say
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself
And now in my heart, I know I can say what I really feel
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air
On the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio

If you think that love isn't found on the radio
Then tune right in, you may find the love you lost
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago
It sounded really loud, they said it really loud
On the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, on the radio"

Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too but

It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know
Doesn't really know

Away from these long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right

And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone...

My mind was drifting off on Martinique Bay
It's not that I'm not interested, you see;
Augusta, Georgia is just no place to be

I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go;
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove

Keep on talking, mama, I can hear
Your voice, it tickles down inside of my ear
I feel a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear

I think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go;
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove

Voila! An American Dream
Well, we can travel girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign

Just keep talking, mama, I like that sound
It goes so easy with that rain falling down
I think a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to this hillbilly fear

Voila! An American Dream
Yeah, we can travel, girl, without any means
When it's as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign

Just think Jamaican in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking rum every night
We got no money, mama, but we can go;
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove"

One fine day, you'll look at me
And you will know our love was, meant to be
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

The arms I long for, will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me, right by your side
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting, and, someday darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down
Oh!

One fine day, we'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

1675,You May Be Right,Billy Joel,Billy Joel,You May Be Right Billy Joel,"Friday night, I crashed your party
Saturday, I said I'm sorry
Sunday, came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting any one
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

[Chorus]
You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
Beause you might enjoy some madness for a while
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

Your beauty steals my breath away

When you look into my eyes
I find it hard to find the words to say

Wanna run away and hide
I just got to let you know
Feel so tangled up inside
I should have never let you go

(should have never let her go)

Anyone can make mistakes
And we both have made our share

But a life without your love
Is a life too hard to bear

I don't care who's right or wrong
Only know I love you so

Why did I have to write this song
I should have never let you go

Why in all the wide, wide world
Have I run into you here
Wish I could disappear

I'll never understand

I'll never understand

Why I even give a damn

When you walk into a room
You know I stand on shaky ground

I've built so many walls around me
Now the walls are tumbling down

You're the kind I can't forget

Let the tears begin to flow

I have only one regret
I should have never let you.....go
Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go"

Don't know what I'm going through
Standing here looking at you

Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad

It makes me hurt so bad to see you again

Like needles and pins
People say ""you've been making out okay
He's in love don't stand in his way""

Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away
Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before please love me again
I can't let you go back to her
Please don't go
Please don't go

Please don't go

Hurt so bad
Come back it hurts so bad
Don't make it hurt so bad

So far from where we used to be

Well speakin' just for me
And some people from Tennessee
We've got a thing or two to tell you all
This lady may have stumbled
But she ain't never fell
And if the Russians don't believe that
They can all go straight to hell
We're gonna put her feet back
On the path of righteousness and then

And we're talkin' real loud again (In America)

That it ever would happen again

From The Sound up in Long Island
Out to San Francisco Bay
And everything that's in between them is our own
And we may have done a little bit
Of fightin' amongst ourselves
But you outside people best leave us alone
'Cause we'll all stick together
And you can take that to the bank
That's the cowboys and the hippies
And the rebels and the yanks
You just go and lay your hand
On a Pittsburgh Steelers' fan
And I think you're gonna finally understand

Just my father and me
And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air
Hangin' still everywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say hold my hand

I said, love's easier when it's far away
We sat and watched the distant light

We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

There's a boat on the line
Where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I
Are like strangers, a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time

He said, it's harder now, we're far away
We only read you when you write

We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

We're just ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

Start in the morning and get the job done
Take care of business and we have some fun

Turn it up and then we'll sing along
Sing along
Oh, we're stayin' up all night long

You believe what you want to believe

You see, you don't have to live like a refugee

Baby, we ain't the first
I'm sure a lot of other lovers been burned
Right now this seems real to you
But it's one of those things

Tied up, taken away, and held for ransom

If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away

What I want: us together again baby

Mmmm, mmmm

[Verse 1]
Say good-bye
To not knowing when
The truth in my whole life began
Say good-bye
To not knowing how to cry
You taught me that

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The strength that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you saved me
I'll remember

[Verse 2]
Inside
I was a child
That could not mend a broken wing
Outside
I looked for a way
To teach my heart to sing

[Chorus]
And I'll remember
The love that you gave me
Now that I'm standing on my own
I'll remember
The way that you changed me
I'll remember

[Verse 3]
I learned
To let go of the illusion that we can possess
I learned
To let go
I travel in stillness

No, I've never been afraid to cry
Now I finally have a reason why

Alright
Come on now
Yeah
Talk to me
Yeah

[Hook: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yeah

[Verse 1: Salt]
I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
Cuz I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect, I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

[Hook: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Heeh

[Verse 2: Pepa]
My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

[Hook: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that

I've got a good man

[Hook: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

He's a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty mighty good man

Now break it down
I break it down one time

And you comb your hair and grab your coat and hat

All those wild nights breeze through your mind

And everything looks so complete
When you're walking out on the streets
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying
Oooh, oo-ooh wee
The wild night is calling

All the girls walk by dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passing by just stare with the wild wonder
And the inside jukebox roars just like thunder

And everything looks so complete
When you're walking out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying, crying
Oooh, oo-ooh wee

Why I should believe you
Believe in all the things that you tell

My heart wants to receive you
Just make me know that you are sincere

Now it's gonna take some workin'
But I believe you're worth it
Long as your intentions are good (so good)
There is just one way to show it
And boy I hope you know it
That no one could love you like I could
Lord knows I want to trust you
And always how I'd love you
I'm not sure if love is enough
And I will not be forsaken
And I hope there's no mistakin'
So tell me that you'll always be true

There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

[Chorus]
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

And can you feel the love tonight?
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

[Verse 2]
There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

Come on y'all, let's take a ride
Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cuz you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin, ain't no crippin
Ain't no punk ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission

I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide, slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

[Verse 2: Coolio]
I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
(Come along and ride on a Fantastic Voyage)
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggas can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot, swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin' everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin'
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by?
You better be ready so you can ride

[Hook]
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity slide if you're living in the city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage

[Intro]
Regulators. We regulate any stealin' of his property. We‚Äôre damn good too. But you can‚Äôt be any geek off the street. You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean. Earn your keep. Regulators, mount up!

[Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

[Nate Dogg]
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

[Warren G]
So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said ""Let's do this!""
I jumped out the ride and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said ""I'm stuck!""

[Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homie and some suckas all in his mix

[Warren G]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they takin' Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother, said ""Damn, what's next?""

[Nate Dogg]
They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him if they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them bustas down

[Warren G]
They got guns to my head, I think I'm goin' down
I can't believe it's happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate

[Nate Dogg]
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

{Interlude}

[Nate Dogg]
I laid all them bustas down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

[Warren G]
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, ‚Äòcause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

[Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""Ooh, I like your size!""
She said ""My car's broke down
And you seem real nice, would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's goin' real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

{Interlude}

[Warren G]
I'm tweakin' into a whole new era
G-funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level

[Nate Dogg]
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

[Warren G]
Chords, strings, we brings melody
G-funk, where rhythm is life and life is rhythm

[Nate Dogg]
If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-funk era, funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you're high like everyday
And if yo' ass is a busta, 213 will regulate"

1725,Now and Forever,Richard Marx,Richard Marx,Now and Forever Richard Marx,"Whenever I'm weary
From the battles that rage in my head
You make sense of madness
When my sanity hangs by a thread
I lose my way but still you seem to understand
Now and forever, I will be your man

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever, I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time
All this time

Until the day the ocean doesn't touch the sand
Now and forever, I will be your man
Now and forever, I will be your man"

When does the pain ever end?
When do the tears stop from running over?
When does ""you'll get over it"" begin?

I hear what you're sayin'
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you

And when can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you...

When does my someday begin?
When I'll find someone again?
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then, baby, baby?

Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense
So when can I see you...

You came to me like the dawn through the night
Just shinin' like the sun
Out of my dreams and into my life
You are the one, you are the one

Said I loved you but I was wrong
'Cause love could never ever feel so strong
Said I loved you but I lied

With all my soul I've tried in vain
How can mere words my heart explain

Need you forever, I need you to stay
You are the one, you are the one

This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either

[Verse 1]
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name's William but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Bridge]
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

[Chorus Variation]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard"

Once there was this kid who
Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
But when he finally came back
His hair had turned from black into bright white
He said that it was from when
The cars had smashed so hard

[Chorus]
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm

[Verse 2]
Once there was this girl who
Wouldn't go and change with the girls in the change room
But when they finally made her
They saw birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just been there

[Chorus] (2x)

[Bridge]
But both girl and boy were glad
Cause one kid had it worse than that

[Verse 3]

Parents made him come directly home right after school
And when they went to their church
They shook and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just gone there"

And I started, started pretending
That I knew you, and you knew me too

And I tried to come closer, but could not walk
And I think of it every night
Ohh I just could not get it right! OH!

Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it!

That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and thats a fact
I would do anything for love!
And there'll never be no turning back

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long

Will you take me to places I'll never know?

Meat Loaf: I can do that!
I can do that!

Lorraine Crosby: After a while you'll forget everything
Just a brief interlude, and a mid-summer night's fling
Then you'll see that it's time to move on

Meat Loaf: I won't do that
I won't do that

Lorraine Crosby: I know the territory - I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
Sooner or later you'll be screwing around

Meat Loaf: I won't do that!
No I won't do that!

Anything for love
Oh I would do anything for love!
I would do anything for love!
But I won't do that!
No I won't do that..."
1739,Gangsta Lean,DRS,DRS,Gangsta Lean DRS,"[Verse 1]
This song's dedicated
To my homies in that gangsta lean
Why'd you have to go so soon?
It seems like yesterday
We were hangin 'round the hood
Now I'm gonna
Keep your memory alive
Like a homie should

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be- We'll be hangin' out

[Chorus]
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean
This is for my homies
This is for my homies, well well
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean

[Verse 2]
My God, my God
Could you pass on a message for me?
Tell him put down those dice for a second, Lord
Listen to his homie
Could you tell him
I'll never let go of his memory?
So his son will know
He don't have to cry no more
Cause God's got his back, I said God's got his back

A lifetime of memories
Going down the drain
I'd like to keep steppin'
But I can't get past the pain

I tip my 40 to your memory
Take a drink, and I
Stop to think, and I
I know one day soon
We'll be, we'll be hangin out

[Chorus]
This is for my homies
This is for my homies
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean
This is for my homies
This is for my homies
You know I miss you, you know I miss you, my homie
See you when I get there
In that gangsta lean, in that gangsta lean

[Interlude]
This song is decicated to homies in that gangsta lean
Tommy from Master's Touch
My boy Y-B
And my boy Eibere
And whoever else out there
Thats gotta homie thats in a gangsta lean
And also my boys in the pen
That ain't ever gonna see the street again
Cause you know what?
It dont matter what they was doing while they was here
They couldve been bangin', slangin'
But they ain't here no more
And thats somebody's daddy
Somebody's baby, that's somebody's homie
So go on and let 'em rest while they in that gangsta lean
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's on the real, loc

[Chorus/Outro]
This is for my homies
I can't believe that your gone
See you when I get there

Hold me close, n' try n' understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

C'mon now, try n' understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt ya now, can't hurt ya now, can't hurt ya now...

Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

Have I doubt, baby, when I'm alone
Love is a ring, a telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed 'til the morning comes

C'mon now, try n' understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand, as the sun descends
They can't hurt ya now, can't hurt ya now, can't hurt ya now...

Because the night belongs to lovers

Because the night belongs to us

With love we sleep, with doubt the vicious cycle turns, n' burns
Without you oh I cannot live, forgive the yearnin' burnin'
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So take me now, take me now, take me now...

A recording for Blue Note Records

What's that? Yeah...yeah...yeah
Funky, funky
How 'bout a big hand now
Wait, wait a minute

[Verse 1]
Groovy groovy jazzy funky pounce bounce dance as we
Dip in the melodic sea, the rhythm keeps flowin', and drips to MC
Sweet sugar pop sugar pop rocks it pop
Ya dont stop 'til the sweet beat drops
I show and prove as I stick and move
Vivid poems recited on top of the groove
Smooth, my, floating like a butterfly
Notes set afloat, sung like a lullaby
Brace yourself as the beat hits ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia

(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

[Verse 2]
Feel the beat drop, jazz and hip hop
Drippin in your dome, makes you zone and bop
Funk and fusion, a fly illusion
Keeps ya coastin' on the rhythm you're cruisin'
Up down, round and round, rhymes profound
But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Fantasy freak thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat
Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Poems steady flowin', growin', showin' sights and sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found
Trip the tour upon the rhymes they soar
To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore
Here we go off I take ya
Dip trip, flip fantasia

Itty bitty bop (Yeah)
Itty bitty bop (Funky, funky)

(Yeah...yeah...yeah...What's that?)
(Yeah...yeah...yeah...Funky, funky)

[Verse 3]
Jump to the jam, boogie woogie jam slam
Bust the dialect, I'm the man in command
Come flow with the sounds of the mighty mic master
Rhyming on the mic, I'm bringing suckas their disaster
Beaucoup ducs but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow, words manifest
Feel the vibe from here to Asia
Dip trip, flip fantasia

In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I‚Äôm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
Someone came in saying I‚Äôm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don‚Äôt believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

One‚Äôs on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob

A slab of turkey-neck and its hanging from a pigeon wing

Trade the cash for the beat for the body for the hate
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite

I was yours and you were mine forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies

Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‚ÄòCause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Hook: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back

Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‚Äòcause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just‚Ä¶

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‚ÄòCause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

1754,Streets of Philadelphia,Bruce Springsteen,Bruce Springsteen,Streets of Philadelphia Bruce Springsteen,"I was bruised and battered, I couldn't tell what I felt
I was unrecognizable to myself
I saw my reflection in a window, I didn't know my own face
Oh brother are you gonna leave me wastin' away
On the Streets of Philadelphia

I walked the avenue, 'til my legs felt like stone
I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
It was just as black and whispering as the rain
On the Streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I my friend
My clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away
So receive me brother with your faithless kiss
Or will we leave each other alone like this
On the Streets of Philadelphia"

Here we go here we go as the tune starts to bloom

With some notes from the diggady D-E
As I key what's really goin on
Would ya reminisce with me-e

[Verse 1: Domino]
Saturday mornin' just gettin up
With a hangover smellin' like I fucked
I really can't remember cause I'm still kinda faded
So I close my eyes and thank God that I made it
Now I'm gettin flashbacks of some O.J
With a green glass, says Tanqueray
Took it to the head, gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a bitch so I can handle my business
What do you know, a freak's in my reach
Threw her on the flo', stuck it in her deep
She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin, gettin hoarse
But then I busted a nut, and that was that
So kick the chorus

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Domino]
My homies are down, chillin' in the hood
But them hood bitches, well they ain't no good
To another man well she might be some good cat
But homies in the hood label her as a hood rat
She's scandalous
So those with game can fuck
And ooh, she'll clown your ass real fast, if you're quick to nut
And when you're in that thi-ing
She'll make a nigga si-ng
Duh-du-dway, duh-dum-dway, duh-dum-dway
But you don't hear me doe
Ain't nuthin wrong with being a Trojan man, when ya ridin
So let's kick the chorus please if ya like it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Domino]
My homie's clownin' in his dope, yellow chevy
Too O.D.'ed to be dropped
Kenwood's kickin that funk in the trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah
Rollin down the 'Shaw, guess what we saw, some bitches
The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses
So I approached the freak of the week
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she toted around
Well I offered a backpack
And since I'm a mack
Well you know how the story goes
So all ya hoes and their bros here we go

How can we communicate
If you don't hear what I say
What I need from you is understanding
So simple as 1-2-3
Understanding is what we need

You don't really know me

But you don't wanna meet me half way

But I want some understanding
I want to be with you

I listen to you baby
And I know the things you're going through

That's why I need you baby, pleading baby
Please let our love endure

Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

[Verse 1]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‚ÄòCause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy?
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women ‚Äî do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with a local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‚Äòcause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 3]
And uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‚ÄòCause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‚ÄòCause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You steady hopin' things don't fall down this week
‚ÄòCause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me ‚Äî I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And colder from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep ya head up"

1767,Never Keeping Secrets,Babyface,Babyface,Never Keeping Secrets Babyface,"I never meant to lie to you
But I needed me an easy way out
I couldn't face the truth with you
Because I didn't want to lose my clout
I always have been good to you
Girl I promise you that nothing has changed
Momentary insanity
Must be the reason why I did you that way

So now I'm telling everybody
That I know I was a fool
To take a chance of ever losing
And I can't take losing you

So I'm
Never keeping secrets
And I'm never telling lies
I wanna make it up to you
No I'm
Never keeping secrets
Girl I swear it's all behind
I only wanna be with you

I didn't want to lie to you
But I didn't want to let you down
It never did occur to me
Sooner or later that you would find out
You know how much I care for you
And I would never want to cause you pain
I know that there is no excuse
How could I ever treat my baby that way

That's why I'm telling everybody
That I know I was a fool
But I don't give a damn about it
'Cause I wanna get back wit you

(HOOK)
If you wanna go
I want you to know
Girl that I understand it
But I don't recommened it
'Cause I love you more
I know you can't ignore
That I will die for you
Even lay down my life for you girl
Girl I wanna see
You standing next to me
Girl I apologize
For each and every lie
I want you to be
The only one for me
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever

Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

Turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving
Sends a man right to his grave

Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey

You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough and trying
To tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

Makes me want to pull
Down the shade, yeah
That kind of loving
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same
