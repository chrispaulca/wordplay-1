Whoa, whoa, whoa...yeah

You glanced my way, I lost all control
Anxiety had taken hold
My body quivered, hot flashes ignited in me, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Gazing deep into my eyes
You spoke these words, I was hypnotized
Let me share a night in your fantasy, ooh, ooh

Passion's fire burns on and on

Baby, ignite my fire

You're the object (Sugar) of my desire (Yeah)

When I go to sleep at night
Visions of you here by my side
Fireworks explode deep inside of me, ay-yi-yi-yi
I pinch myself as you're lyin' there
We kiss each other, now I'm really scared
Too much to ask even for a fantasy, oh, oh, oh

Turn on emotions so strong

Like a dark cloud on a crowded stage
You were talking through the smoke in your fantasy
I know you girl, I know what to believe

Maybe things ain't been so good at home
And the people that you love never cared at all
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

Believe it's alright to fantasize
And say the words you think will satisfy me
But you know better than that
'Cause you know what's a lie

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to wake up, ooh
You're living on dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)
It's time to shape up

In your dream, it's overcast
Rain comes down, moving your way fast
You want to run away, don't care where you go
You want to run away, run away, that's all you know

You turn a corner and you see a door
Walk on through, throw yourself on the floor
Oh, when you're looking up, it's no surprise
Standing there is a man with movie star eyes

You think he's gonna take care of you
The man with the plan that'll see you through
And I say there ain't no way
'Cause I know he's a lie

You're living in dreamtime, baby (you want to run away)

I'd say love was a magical flame
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there
I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare
Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared

[Verse 2]
Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care
I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care
No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love
And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear"

Sugar, sugar

She sits alone waiting for suggestions
He's so nervous avoiding all the questions
His lips are dry, her heart is gently pounding
Don't you just know exactly what they're thinking

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so
Tell me so baby

{Bridge}

He's acting shy looking for an answer
Come on honey let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother
They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on honey tell me so
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know

His heart's beating like a drum
'cos at last he's got this girl home
Relax baby now we are all alone

{Instrumental}

They wake at dawn 'cos all the birds are singing
Two total strangers but that ain't what they're thinking
Outside it's cold, misty and it's raining
They got each other neither one's complaining
He say's I sorry but I'm out of milk and coffee
Never mind sugar we can watch the early movie

If you want my body and you think I'm sexy
Come on sugar let me know
If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so

If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on sugar let me know
If you really, really, really, really need me
Just let me know

Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on now go, walk out the door, just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you're the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love, I know I'm still alive
I've got my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive

It took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying with all my mind to mend my broken heart
I spent, so many nights feeling sorry for myself
Oh, I used to cry but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
Not that lonely little person still in love with you
Now you come dropping in expecting me to be free
Now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live, and all my love to give
And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive
Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no

[Verse 2:]
I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground beneath your knees
The birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends

When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint-hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
(Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies
(Keep lookin' for lies, baby keep lookin' for eyes)
'Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

ONE MORNING, very early, I heard Mrs. Todd in the garden outside my window. By the unusual loudness of her remarks to a passer-by, and the notes of a familiar hymn which she sang as she worked among the herbs, and which came as if directed purposely to the sleepy ears of my consciousness, I knew that she wished I would wake up and come and speak to her.

In a few minutes she responded to a morning voice from behind the blinds. “I expect you're goin' up to your schoolhouse to pass all this pleasant day; yes, I expect you're goin' to be dreadful busy,” she said despairingly.

“Perhaps not,” said I. “Why, what's going to be the matter with you, Mrs. Todd?” For I supposed that she was tempted by the fine weather to take one of her favorite expeditions along the shore pastures to gather herbs and simples, and would like to have me keep the house.

“No, I don't want to go nowhere by land,” she answered gayly,—”no, not by land; but I don't know's we shall have a better day all the rest of the summer to go out to Green Island an' see mother. I waked up early thinkin' of her. The wind's light northeast,—'twill take us right straight out, an' this time o' year it's liable to change round southwest an' fetch us home pretty, 'long late in the afternoon. Yes, it's goin' to be a good day.”

“Speak to the captain and the Bowden boy, if you see anybody going by toward the landing,” said I. “We'll take the big boat.”

“Oh, my sakes! now you let me do things my way,” said Mrs. Todd scornfully. “No, dear, we won't take no big bo't. I'll just git a handy dory, an' Johnny Bowden an' me, we'll man her ourselves. I don't want no abler bo't than a good dory, an' a nice light breeze ain't goin' to make no sea; an' Johnny's my cousin's son,—mother'll like to have him come; an' he'll be down to the herrin' weirs all the time we're there, anyway; we don't want to carry no men folks havin' to be considered every minute an' takin' up all our time. No, you let me do; we'll just slip out an' see mother by ourselves. I guess what breakfast you'll want's about ready now.”

I had become well acquainted with Mrs. Todd as landlady, herb-gatherer, and rustic philosopher; we had been discreet fellow-passengers once or twice when I had sailed up the coast to a larger town than Dunnet Landing to do some shopping; but I was yet to become acquainted with her as a mariner. An hour later we pushed off from the landing in the desired dory. The tide was just on the turn, beginning to fall, and several friends and acquaintances stood along the side of the dilapidated wharf and cheered us by their words and evident interest. Johnny Bowden and I were both rowing in haste to get out where we could catch the breeze and put up the small sail which lay clumsily furled along the gunwale. Mrs. Todd sat aft, a stern and unbending lawgiver.

“You better let her drift; we'll get there 'bout as quick; the tide'll take her right out from under these old buildin's; there's plenty wind outside.”

“Your bo't ain't trimmed proper, Mis' Todd!” exclaimed a voice from shore. “You're lo'ded so the bo't'll drag; you can't git her before the wind, ma'am. You set 'midships, Mis' Todd, an' let the boy hold the sheet 'n' steer after he gits the sail up; you won't never git out to Green Island that way. She's lo'ded bad, your bo't is,—she's heavy behind's she is now!”

Mrs. Todd turned with some difficulty and regarded the anxious adviser, my right oar flew out of water, and we seemed about to capsize. “That you, Asa? Good-mornin',” she said politely. “I al'ays liked the starn seat best. When'd you git back from up country?”

This allusion to Asa's origin was not lost upon the rest of the company. We were some little distance from shore, but we could hear a chuckle of laughter, and Asa, a person who was too ready with his criticism and advice on every possible subject, turned and walked indignantly away.

When we caught the wind we were soon on our seaward course, and only stopped to underrun a trawl, for the floats of which Mrs. Todd looked earnestly, explaining that her mother might not be prepared for three extra to dinner; it was her brother's trawl, and she meant to just run her eye along for the right sort of a little haddock. I leaned over the boat's side with great interest and excitement, while she skillfully handled the long line of hooks, and made scornful remarks upon worthless, bait-consuming creatures of the sea as she reviewed them and left them on the trawl or shook them off into the waves. At last we came to what she pronounced a proper haddock, and having taken him on board and ended his life resolutely, we went our way.

As we sailed along I listened to an increasingly delightful commentary upon the islands, some of them barren rocks, or at best giving sparse pasturage for sheep in the early summer. On one of these an eager little flock ran to the water's edge and bleated at us so affectingly that I would willingly have stopped; but Mrs. Todd steered away from the rocks, and scolded at the sheep's mean owner, an acquaintance of hers, who grudged the little salt and still less care which the patient creatures needed. The hot midsummer sun makes prisons of these small islands that are a paradise in early June, with their cool springs and short thick-growing grass. On a larger island, farther out to sea, my entertaining companion showed me with glee the small houses of two farmers who shared the island between them, and declared that for three generations the people had not spoken to each other even in times of sickness or death or birth. “When the news come that the war was over, one of 'em knew it a week, and never stepped across his wall to tell the other,” she said. “There, they enjoy it; they've got to have somethin' to interest 'em in such a place; 'tis a good deal more tryin' to be tied to folks you don't like than 'tis to be alone. Each of 'em tell the neighbors their wrongs; plenty likes to hear and tell again; them as fetch a bone'll carry one, an' so they keep the fight a-goin'. I must say I like variety myself; some folks washes Monday an' irons Tuesday the whole year round, even if the circus is goin' by!”

A long time before we landed at Green Island we could see the small white house, standing high like a beacon, where Mrs. Todd was born and where her mother lived, on a green slope above the water, with dark spruce woods still higher. There were crops in the fields, which we presently distinguished from one another. Mrs. Todd examined them while we were still far at sea. “Mother's late potatoes looks backward; ain't had rain enough so far,” she pronounced her opinion. “They look weedier than what they call Front Street down to Cowper Centre. I expect brother William is so occupied with his herrin' weirs an' servin' out bait to the schooners that he don't think once a day of the land.”

“What's the flag for, up above the spruces there behind the house?” I inquired, with eagerness.

“Oh, that's the sign for herrin',” she explained kindly, while Johnny Bowden regarded me with contemptuous surprise. “When they get enough for schooners they raise that flag; an' when 'tis a poor catch in the weir pocket they just fly a little signal down by the shore, an' then the small bo'ts comes and get enough an' over for their trawls. There, look! there she is: mother sees us; she's wavin' somethin' out o' the fore door! She'll be to the landin'-place quick's we are.”

I looked, and could see a tiny flutter in the doorway, but a quicker signal had made its way from the heart on shore to the heart on the sea.

“How do you suppose she knows it is me?” said Mrs. Todd, with a tender smile on her broad face. “There, you never get over bein' a child long's you have a mother to go to. Look at the chimney, now; she's gone right in an' brightened up the fire. Well, there, I'm glad mother's well; you'll enjoy seein' her very much.”

Mrs. Todd leaned back into her proper position, and the boat trimmed again. She took a firmer grasp of the sheet, and gave an impatient look up at the gaff and the leech of the little sail, and twitched the sheet as if she urged the wind like a horse. There came at once a fresh gust, and we seemed to have doubled our speed. Soon we were near enough to see a tiny figure with handkerchiefed head come down across the field and stand waiting for us at the cove above a curve of pebble beach.

Presently the dory grated on the pebbles, and Johnny Bowden, who had been kept in abeyance during the voyage, sprang out and used manful exertions to haul us up with the next wave, so that Mrs. Todd could make a dry landing.

“You don that very well,” she said, mounting to her feet, and coming ashore somewhat stiffly, but with great dignity, refusing our outstretched hands, and returning to possess herself of a bag which had lain at her feet.

“Well, mother, here I be!” she announced with indifference; but they stood and beamed in each other's faces.

“Lookin' pretty well for an old lady, ain't she?” said Mrs. Todd's mother, turning away from her daughter to speak to me. She was a delightful little person herself, with bright eyes and an affectionate air of expectation like a child on a holiday. You felt as if Mrs. Blackett were an old and dear friend before you let go her cordial hand. We all started together up the hill.

“Now don't you haste too fast, mother,” said Mrs. Todd warningly; “'tis a far reach o' risin' ground to the fore door, and you won't set an' get your breath when you're once there, but go trotting about. Now don't you go a mite faster than we proceed with this bag an' basket. Johnny, there, 'll fetch up the haddock. I just made one stop to underrun William's trawl till I come to jes' such a fish's I thought you'd want to make one o' your nice chowders of. I've brought an onion with me that was layin' about on the window-sill at home.”

“That's just what I was wantin',” said the hostess. “I give a sigh when you spoke o' chowder, knowin' my onions was out. William forgot to replenish us last time he was to the Landin'. Don't you haste so yourself Almiry, up this risin' ground. I hear you commencin' to wheeze a'ready.”

This mild revenge seemed to afford great pleasure to both giver and receiver. They laughed a little, and looked at each other affectionately, and then at me. Mrs. Todd considerately paused, and faced about to regard the wide sea view. I was glad to stop, being more out of breath than either of my companions, and I prolonged the halt by asking the names of the neighboring islands. There was a fine breeze blowing, which we felt more there on the high land than when we were running before it in the dory.

“Why, this ain't that kitten I saw when I was out last, the one that I said didn't appear likely?” exclaimed Mrs. Todd as we went our way.

“That's the one, Almiry,” said her mother. “She always had a likely look to me, an' she's right after business. I never see such a mouser for one of her age. If't wan't for William, I never should have housed that other dronin' old thing so long; but he sets by her on account of her havin' a bob tail. I don't deem it advisable to maintain cats just on account of their havin' bob tails; they're like all other curiosities, good for them that wants to see 'm twice. This kitten catches mice for both, an' keeps me respectable as I ain't been for a year. She's a real understandin' little help, this kitten is. I picked her from among five Miss Augusta Pernell had over to Burnt Island,” said the old woman, trudging along with the kitten close at her skirts. “Augusta, she says to me, 'Why, Mis' Blackett, you've took and homeliest;' and, says I, 'I've got the smartest; I'm satisfied.'“

“I'd trust nobody sooner'n you to pick out a kitten, mother,” said the daughter handsomely, and we went on in peace and harmony.

The house was just before us now, on a green level that looked as if a huge hand had scooped it out of the long green field we had been ascending. A little way above, the dark, spruce woods began to climb the top of the hill and cover the seaward slopes of the island. There was just room for the small farm and the forest; we looked down at the fish-house and its rough sheds, and the weirs stretching far out into the water. As we looked upward, the tops of the firs came sharp against the blue sky. There was a great stretch of rough pasture-land round the shoulder of the island to the eastward, and here were all the thick-scattered gray rocks that kept their places, and the gray backs of many sheep that forever wandered and fed on the thin sweet pasturage that fringed the ledges and made soft hollows and strips of green turf like growing velvet. I could see the rich green of bayberry bushes here and there, where the rocks made room. The air was very sweet; one could not help wishing to be a citizen of such a complete and tiny continent and home of fisherfolk.

The house was broad and clean, with a roof that looked heavy on its low walls. It was one of the houses that seem firm-rooted in the ground, as if they were two-thirds below the surface, like icebergs. The front door stood hospitably open in expectation of company, and an orderly vine grew at each side; but our path led to the kitchen door at the house-end, and there grew a mass of gay flowers and greenery, as if they had been swept together by some diligent garden broom into a tangled heap: there were portulacas all along under the lower step and straggling off into the grass, and clustering mallows that crept as near as they dared, like poor relations. I saw the bright eyes and brainless little heads of two half-grown chickens who were snuggled down among the mallows as if they had been chased away from the door more than once, and expected to be again.

“It seems kind o' formal comin' in this way,” said Mrs. Todd impulsively, as we passed the flowers and came to the front doorstep; but she was mindful of the proprieties, and walked before us into the best room on the left.

“Why, mother, if you haven't gone an' turned the carpet!” she exclaimed, with something in her voice that spoke of awe and admiration. “When'd you get to it? I s'pose Mis' Addicks come over an' helped you, from White Island Landing?”

“No, she didn't,” answered the old woman, standing proudly erect, and making the most of a great moment. “I done it all myself with William's help. He had a spare day, an' took right holt with me; an' 'twas all well beat on the grass, an' turned, an' put down again afore we went to bed. I ripped an' sewed over two o' them long breadths. I ain't had such a good night's sleep for two years.”

“There, what do you think o' havin' such a mother as that for eighty-six year old?” said Mrs. Todd, standing before us like a large figure of Victory.

As for the mother, she took on a sudden look of youth; you felt as if she promised a great future, and was beginning, not ending, her summers and their happy toils.

“My, my!” exclaimed Mrs. Todd. “I couldn't ha' done it myself, I've got to own it.”

“I was much pleased to have it off my mind,” said Mrs. Blackett, humbly; “the more so because along at the first of the next week I wasn't very well. I suppose it may have been the change of weather.”

Mrs. Todd could not resist a significant glance at me, but, with charming sympathy, she forbore to point the lesson or to connect this illness with its apparent cause. She loomed larger than ever in the little old-fashioned best room, with its few pieces of good furniture and pictures of national interest. The green paper curtains were stamped with conventional landscapes of a foreign order,—castles on inaccessible crags, and lovely lakes with steep wooded shores; under-foot the treasured carpet was covered thick with home-made rugs. There were empty glass lamps and crystallized bouquets of grass and some fine shells on the narrow mantelpiece.

“I was married in this room,” said Mrs. Todd unexpectedly; and I heard her give a sigh after she had spoken, as if she could not help the touch of regret that would forever come with all her thoughts of happiness.

“We stood right there between the windows,” she added, “and the minister stood here. William wouldn't come in. He was always odd about seein' folks, just's he is now. I run to meet 'em from a child, an' William, he'd take an' run away.”

“I've been the gainer,” said the old mother cheerfully. “William has been son an' daughter both since you was married off the island. He's been 'most too satisfied to stop at home 'long o' his old mother, but I always tell 'em I'm the gainer.”

We were all moving toward the kitchen as if by common instinct. The best room was too suggestive of serious occasions, and the shades were all pulled down to shut out the summer light and air. It was indeed a tribute to Society to find a room set apart for her behests out there on so apparently neighborless and remote an island. Afternoon visits and evening festivals must be few in such a bleak situation at certain seasons of the year, but Mrs. Blackett was of those who do not live to themselves, and who have long since passed the line that divides mere self-concern from a valued share in whatever Society can give and take. There were those of her neighbors who never had taken the trouble to furnish a best room, but Mrs. Blackett was one who knew the uses of a parlor.

“Yes, do come right out into the old kitchen; I shan't make any stranger of you,” she invited us pleasantly, after we had been properly received in the room appointed to formality. “I expect Almiry, here, 'll be driftin' out 'mongst the pasture-weeds quick's she can find a good excuse. 'Tis hot now. You'd better content yourselves till you get nice an' rested, an' 'long after dinner the sea-breeze 'll spring up, an' then you can take your walks, an' go up an' see the prospect from the big ledge. Almiry'll want to show off everything there is. Then I'll get you a good cup o' tea before you start to go home. The days are plenty long now.”

While we were talking in the best room the selected fish had been mysteriously brought up from the shore, and lay all cleaned and ready in an earthen crock on the table.

“I think William might have just stopped an' said a word,” remarked Mrs. Todd, pouting with high affront as she caught sight of it. “He's friendly enough when he comes ashore, an' was remarkable social the last time, for him.”

“He ain't disposed to be very social with the ladies,” explained William's mother, with a delightful glance at me, as if she counted upon my friendship and tolerance. “He's very particular, and he's all in his old fishin'-clothes to-day. He'll want me to tell him everything you said and done, after you've gone. William has very deep affections. He'll want to see you, Almiry. Yes, I guess he'll be in by an' by.”

“I'll search for him by 'n' by, if he don't,” proclaimed Mrs. Todd, with an air of unalterable resolution. “I know all of his burrows down 'long the shore. I'll catch him by hand 'fore he knows it. I've got some business with William, anyway. I brought forty-two cents with me that was due him for them last lobsters he brought in.”

“You can leave it with me,” suggested the little old mother, who was already stepping about among her pots and pans in the pantry, and preparing to make the chowder.

I became possessed of a sudden unwonted curiosity in regard to William, and felt that half the pleasure of my visit would be lost if I could not make his interesting acquaintance."

A rumor has it that it's getting late
Time marches on, just can't wait
The clock keeps turning, why hesitate?
You silly fool; you can't change your fate
Let's cut a rug, a little jive and jitterbug
We want the best, we won't settle for less
Don't be a drag; participate
Clams on the half shell, and roller-skates, roller-skates

[Hook]
Good times
These are the good times
Leave your cares behind

620,You Don't Bring Me Flowers,Neil Diamond & Barbra Streisand,Neil Diamond,You Don't Bring Me Flowers Neil Diamond,"You don't bring me flowers
You don't sing me love songs
You hardly talk to me anymore
When you come through the door
At the end of the day

I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me

Now after lovin' me late at night
When it's good for you
And you're feeling alright
Well, you just roll over
And you turn out the light

You don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural
To talk about forever
But 'used to be's' don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor
'Til we sweep them away

And baby, I remember
All the things you taught me
I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry
Well I learned how to love
Even learned how to lie

You'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
'Cause you don't bring me flowers
Anymore

Well, you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye
'Cause you don't bring me flowers
Anymore"

You better knock, knock on wood, baby

Yes, I'm not superstitious about ya
But I can't take no chance

I'll always need you
I'll never leave you
Come on and lead me on
Tease me all night long

Than someone who never had a part of you

You know I told you from the start
Exactly how I feel
Time goes on, seems nothing's changed
I'm in love for real
We have never played the games
That real lovers do
So maybe we are better off

625,Don't Cry Out Loud,Melissa Manchester,Melissa Manchester,Don't Cry Out Loud Melissa Manchester,"Baby cried the day the circus came to town
'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
While she danced without a net upon the wire
I know a lot about her, 'cause you see
Baby is an awful lot like me

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside
And learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember you almost had it all

Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
They left behind her dreams among the litter
And the different kind of love she thought she'd found
There was nothing left but sawdust and some glitter
But Baby can't be broken, 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher, that was me
I told her

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside
And learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember you almost had it all

Don't cry out loud
Just keep it inside
And learn how to hide your feelings
Fly high and proud
And if you should fall
Remember you almost made it

Don't cry out loud

When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily
Joyfully, playfully watching me
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible
Logical, responsible, practical
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Clinical, intellectual, cynical

For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am

Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
Liberal, fanatical, criminal

Acceptable, respectable, presentable, a vegetable

For awhile, to love was all we could do
We were young and we knew
In our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile, we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night, something right
Would invite us to begin the day

[Pre-Chorus]
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Something happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had

[Chorus]
And, oh, after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?
Oh, oh, oh, after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found?

[Verse 2]
For awhile, to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was wrong
Oh, baby, wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
Till sadness was all we shared
We were scared
This affair would lead our love into

[Pre-Chorus]
Something happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Something happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Something happened along the way
Oh, and yesterday was all we had

How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around?

639,The Gambler,Kenny Rogers,Kenny Rogers,The Gambler Kenny Rogers,"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life, out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back towards the window
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done"

At a guy who stuck out in the crowd

And a face that would make any man proud

And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, find a way...

While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true...

And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I will find a way, while she waits... while she waits for me"

You reach for the shelf and cradle it down
The Music Box Dancer, what does it prove
Only that you need to see a statue that moves
A tutu of satin, bordered with lace
Slender lines, agile legs, a wonderland face
Her beauty is balanced, an immovable pose
Eternally destined to remain on her toes

Music Box Dancer, she is only a toy
Project upon her your dreams of wanting life's joy
She's perched on her stand, and never will part
A final gaze upon her, now the music will start

You wind the doll up, it's nostalgic because
You've been here before, so give one final pause
To dream of the future, to reflect on the past
Music Box Dancer start your whirling at last

The room fills with music, such a cute song
Watching her go 'round and 'round, she's where she belongs
Bring joy to the watchers, spreading a glow
Whenever wound up, she'll put on a good show

Music Box Dancer, do you think or believe
She could step off her box if she wanted to leave
So easy it is, twirl around with such grace
Staying in her circle, she remains in one place

Such a brief moment, a small time to spend
The dancing will slow soon, the music will end
In real life we're plastic, nature's unfair
How can we breathe life, how can we share
The knowledge and insights hidden in tombs
We're all Music Box Dancers all alone in our rooms
We sit on our shelves where objects reside
We don't allow the music to get right inside

Music Box Dancer's now completely alone
No winder or no listener, because nobody's home
How long before someone will re-wind the spring?
The room will now be witness; and silence can't sing"
649,The Devil Went Down to Georgia,The Charlie Daniels Band,The Charlie,The Devil Went Down to Georgia The Charlie,"The Devil went down to Georgia. He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind cause he was way behind. He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""

""I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul cause I think I'm better than you.""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet; and you're gonna regret cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

[Demonic violin piece]

When the Devil finished, Johnny said, ""Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done.""

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no

[Non-demonic violin piece]

The Devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, ""Devil, just come on back if you ever wanna try again
Cause I've told you once--you son of a bitch--I'm the best there's ever been.""
And he played:

""Fire on the Mountain."" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun;
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no"

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets

The mirror stares you in the face
And says ""Baby, uh, uh, it don't work""
You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt

Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland

All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying

I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

You've tried everything but you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love what I would not do

You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park
But meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear that music ring

[Verse 2]
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
But the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

[Verse 3]
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

[Verse 4]
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – He's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

[Instrumental Solo]

[Verse 6]
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
""We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing"""

He's a loser, but he still keeps on tryin'

Unlucky in love, least that's what they say

Staked his heart and lost, now he has to pay the cost

Have you heard about the lonesome loser

Though this loneliness is driving him crazy
He don't show what goes on in his head

All round the day was goin' down slow
Night like a river beginning to flow
I felt the beat of my mind go
Drifting into time passages
Years go falling in the fading light
Time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Well I'm not the kind to live in the past
The years run too short and the days too fast
The things you lean on, are the things that don't last
Well it's just now and then, my line gets cast into these
Time passages
There's something back here that you left behind
Oh, time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

Well the picture is changing, now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something, and the music's loud
A girl comes towards you, you once used to know
You reach out your hand, but you're all alone in these
Time passages
I know you're in there, you're just out of sight
Oh, time passages

And no one is hearin a word
Just tryin to escape the frustrations
Till a song in the night can be heard

Put on your dancin shoes
Throw out those one-night blues
Heres one to love and to chance
For a spin on that wheel of romance

Too slow to unriddle your problems
Too lonely for someone to care
Long, lonely silence keeps haunting
Till the song in the night finds you there

Put on your dancin shoes
Throw out those one-night blues
And her..."

Thought I had my degree
In life and how love
Ought to be a run
I had a one step plan to prove it
Guide in my pocket for fools
Folly and fun
Love had to show me one thing

Anyone who claimed that I
Didn't control
Whatever moved in my soul

Touch delight
Just because you fell for me
Why should I feel uptight

Telling me your sorrows, in the tracings of your tears

If you just want to cry to somebody, don't cry to me, no
Don't cry to me, no

Didn't I hear your voice this morning, didn't you call my name?
I heard you whisper softly, but the words were never plain
And in your dream of darkness, I came shinin' like the sun
Waiting for the laughter, but the laughter never comes

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody, dont cry to me, no

There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know you've got somewhere to go
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?
And don't you ever leave

Lay down, Sally and rest you in my arms

Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you

We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies love is all that matters
Won't you stay with me? Don't you ever leave

Coloring your face so dreamily
So don't you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me

You just appear
You said ""hello""

Feel so good when I'm with you
I can't believe you love me too

Young boys they all want to take her home

Time on my side
I got it all
I heard that pride
Always comes before a fall
There's a rumour goin' 'round the town
That you don't want me around
I can't shake off my city blues
Everywhere I turn, I lose

You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

Time is no healer
If you're not there
Lonely fever
Sad words in the air
Some things are better left unsaid
I'm gonna spend my days in bed
I'll walk the streets at night
To be hidden by the city lights, city lights

Love is like oxygen
You get too much, you get too high
Not enough and you're gonna die
Love gets you high

[Verse 1]
Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, there's a quiet little town
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
Cus he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone
And when you wake up it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin' it's a new mornin'
You're goin', you're goin' home

732,Sometimes When We Touch,Dan Hill,Dan Hill,Sometimes When We Touch Dan Hill,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie
And who am I to judge you
On what you say or do?
I'm only just beginning to see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance and all its strategy
Leaves me battling with my pride
But through the insecurity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly

At times I understand you
And I know how hard you've tried
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you til I die
Til we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides"

We lived happily forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out on the pot of gold
But we'll try best that we can, to carry on

I feel so bad I got a worried mind
I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickles, saving dimes
Working til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fun
And the world is mine
On Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats
With their sails afloat
If I could only see
That familiar sunrise
Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

Gonna see my baby again
Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again
On Blue Bayou

Saving nickles saving dimes
Working til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times
On Blue Bayou

I'm going back someday
Come what may
To Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fun
And the world is mine

Through sleepy eyes
How happy I'd be

By my side
The silver moon
And the evening tide
Oh some sweet day
Gonna take away
This hurting inside

Well I'll never be blue
My dreams come true

So won't you smile for the camera
I know they're gonna love it

I keep it with your letter
Done up in blueprint blue
It sure looks good on you
And when you smile for the camera
I know I'll love you better

I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity

Я хочу быть автоматом, стреляющим в лица

[Verse 1]
Варенье из солнца на козырьке
В рюкзаке стихотворенья на собственном языке
В случайном автобусе вру в диктофон
Я всегда в расфокусе, я всегда фон
Сосредоточенный, как самоубийца
Я брожу по городу, мечтая совокупиться
Вокруг бессмысленные бляди обоих полов, а
Из обломков облаков — Бог как боеголовка

Я не хочу быть красивым, не хочу быть богатым

[Verse 2]
Одинокие двуногие, сторукая орда
Люди пахнут супом, как старухина манда
Очереди в очереди к кожному врачу
Я ничего не чувствую, я больше не хочу
Я не хочу перепихон, я хочу Иерихон
На пуле-дуре верхом, голодным еретиком
Мне катиться и катиться по проспектам колесом -
Одинокий юноша с простреленным лицом

[Verse 3]
Закрой калитку, какаду!
Мой рэп — это молитва, только с бритвою во рту
Я — выкидыш русской изнанки
В столице как рисинка в брюхе вьетнамки
Иисус Христос заказывал барагоз
И я поднимаю тост за классовый холокост
(Шучу) Глотают братья смешки
Папины детки, собирайте кишки

She stood there bright as the sun on that California coast
He was a Midwestern boy on his own
She looked at him with those soft eyes, so innocent and blue
He knew right then he was too far from home
He was too far from home

She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles up those twisting, turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

{Bridge}

He'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face that would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
He had lost all control

Night after night, day after day, it went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights on LA
Wondering if he could ever go home

And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
It was giving him chills
In those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
With a passion that kills

In those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills

In those Hollywood nights...."

This is the day
Of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past

You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

[Chorus]
I'll learn to work the saxophone
I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues

[Verse 2]
My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind

I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

[Chorus]
I'll learn to work the saxophone
I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues

[Verse 3]
This is the night
Of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

All the bazaar men by the Nile
They got the money on a bet
Gold crocodiles (oh-way-oh)
They snap their teeth on your cigarette

Foreign types with the hookah pipes say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

The blonde waitresses take their trays
They spin around and they cross the floor
They've got the moves (oh-way-oh)
You drop your drink, then they bring you more

All the school kids so sick of books
They like the punk and the metal band
When the buzzer rings (oh-way-oh)
They're walking like an Egyptian

All the kids in the marketplace say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian

Slide your feet up the street, bend your back
Shift your arm, then you pull it back
Life is hard you know (oh-way-oh)
So strike a pose on a Cadillac

If you want to find all the cops
They're hanging out in the donut shop
They sing and dance (oh-way-oh)
They spin the clubs, cruise down the block

All the Japanese with their yen
The party boys call the Kremlin
And the Chinese know (oh-way-oh)
They walk the line like Egyptian

All the cops in the donut shop say
(Way-oh-way-oh, ooh-way-oh-way-oh)
Walk like an Egyptian
Walk like an Egyptian"

I hear the ticking of the clock
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark
I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Oh, I hope that it won't end though
Alone

[Chorus]
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

[Verse 2]
You don't know how long I have wanted
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh
You don't know how long I have waited
And I was gonna tell you tonight
But the secret is still my own
And my love for you is still unknown
Alone

[Chorus]
Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

Clocks strikes upon the hour

So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay for love
For love

She says, ""We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot""

Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Oh-oh, livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in
When he used to make it talk
So tough, ooh it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers ""Baby it's okay
Someday""

We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not

I've never seen you shine so bright

They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

There's nobody here
It's just you and me

But I hardly know this beauty by my side

I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright

And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

But each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always, ""No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding ring""

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
""Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself""

Ooh, baby, baby, baby
Why you gonna treat me this way?
You know I'm still your loverboy
I still feel the same way
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said
""No huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding vow""

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
""Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself""

You see, I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in
That's when she started talking about true love
Started talking about sin

I said
""Honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life""
She said
No huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife""

My honey, my baby
Don't put my love upon no shelf
She said
""Don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself"""

Like a warrior that fights
And wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights
Consumed by the shadows
And was crippled emotionally

I escaped (ahaha)
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting
Knew you were waiting for me, uh huh
With and endless desire
I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like the bridge is on fire
The hurt is over
One touch and you set me free
No, I don't regret a single moment, no I don't
(I know you don't) Looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh
When the river was deep I didn't falter
When the mountain was high I still believed
When the valley was low it didn't stop me (oh)
I knew you were waiting (hey)
Knew you were waiting for me

I still believed (Oh, when the valley was low)

Knew you were waiting for me

838,Somewhere Out There,Linda Ronstadt and James Ingram,Linda Ronstadt,Somewhere Out There Linda Ronstadt,"Somewhere out there
Beneath the pale moonlight
Someone's thinking of me
And loving me tonight

Somewhere out there
Someone's saying a prayer
That we'll find one another
In that big somewhere out there

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true

And even though I know how very far apart we are
It helps to think we might be wishing
On the same bright star

And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby
It helps to think we're sleeping
Underneath the same big sky

Somewhere out there
If love can see us through
Then we'll be together
Somewhere out there
Out where dreams come true"
839,Land of Confusion,Genesis,Genesis,Land of Confusion Genesis,"I must've dreamed a thousand dreams
Been haunted by a million screams
But I can hear the marching feet
They're moving into the street

Now did you read the news today ?
They say the danger's gone away
But I can see the fires still alight
They're burning into the night

There's too many men, too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion ?

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

Ooh, Superman, where are you now ?
When everything's gone wrong somehow
The men of steel, the men of power
Are losing control by the hour

This is the time, this is the place
So we look for the future
But there's not much love to go round
Tell me why this is a land of confusion

This is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth living in

I remember long ago
Ooh when the sun was shining
Yes and the stars were bright all through the night
And the sound of your laughter as I held you tight
So long ago

I won't be coming home tonight
My generation will put it right
We're not just making promises
That we know we'll never keep

Too many men, there's too many people
Making too many problems
And not much love to go round
Can't you see this is a land of confusion ?

[Chorus]
Now this is the world we live in
And these are the hands we're given
Use them and let's start trying
To make it a place worth fighting for
This is the world we live in
And these are the names we're given
Stand up and let's start showing
Just where our lives are going to"

It started me thinking, wondering
What I could make of my life, and who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself but never finding the answers

Crying at the top of my voice and no one listening
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget

I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh, I know you're going but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to

I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you
All this time, I still remember everything you said, oh
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget

You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps

Only thinking about myself, oh

Just caring bout somebody else

No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

[Verse 2]
Take me as I am
Put your heart in mine, stay with me forever
Because I am just a man who never understood
I never had a thing to prove
There was you
You and me
Then it all came clear so suddenly
How close to you that I wanna be

[Chorus]
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on
No, I can't go on
I can't go on
If I'm on my own

[Verse 3]
Do you believe a love could run so strong?
Do you believe a love could pass you by?
There was no special one for me
I was the lonely one, you see
But then my heart lost all control
Now you're all that I know

[Chorus]
Just say you'll love me for the rest of your life
I got a lot of love and I don't want to let go
Will you still love me for the rest of my life?
Because I can't go on (Can't go on)
No, I can't go on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
I can't go on without somebody I can count on
Because I can't go on (Will you still love me?)
No, I can't go on (Just say you love me)
Stay around, and never be alone"

Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live

Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me

Died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle
And soon she did the same

And their idea of fun
Is being in a gang called The Disciples
High on crack, totin' a machine gun

Time, time

Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church
And killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story
Is tellin' you somebody died
Sister killed her baby 'cuz she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June

Times, times

It's silly, no'
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh why
Time, time

Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn

It's silly, no'
When a rocket blows
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies

It played on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away once again...whoa, again

Oh, I watch the sidewheel spin
And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow

Like fake London genius
Pretty shit, first season was alright but that's about it
You like music that much then start fucking listening to it
Deep down, I bought the sweater
Used it as cocaine pyjamas
What a waste of dough
Pulling it out when I'm on the snow
Fucking waste, didn't feel right as a daytime top
Felt like I was try to be trendy when I'm not
So when I got in and I was off me bollocks, mates are like ""Fuck, even his pyjamas are proper.""
Yeah, mate
I don't fuck about
I'm making sure I don't get my kids anything to fucking feel embarrassed about

Of the track 'bout the honey shakin rumps and they backs in
Booties of the cuties steady shakin but relaxin
The action, is packed in a jam like a closet
Beats bound to get you up, cold flowin like a faucet
Not mean to make you sit, not mean to make you jump

Shake it baby shake it baby shake it don't STOPPA

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
(‘Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together
Now you know you're in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas, so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this (hell yeah!)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man
And learnin' her man, and at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught ‘cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

[Hook: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]

Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah!) So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah!)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker, but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit
That's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie: they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, ‘cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit I'ma have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together

How I started the trend of them Daisy Dukes
Ever since, the summer of the ’90s

We're talkin' 'bout the booty, not the breast
Baby got back, the junk in the trunk
She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo
Please, some fries with that shake
See, many terms are used to relate
I love the girls with the big ol' booties
Where I'm from, they call 'em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks, hangin' from the jeans
Even city girls kick the country things
So if you get it, got it good, just dip the dug out
Them damn Daisy Dukes are turnin' 'er out

And check out the way they step
Make your brother wanna think about sex
Especially when they have nice legs
If they're tan, drive off red
It don't mean what kind of legs you like
Still be kickin' those legs in lily white
So it won't make one difference on you

Because me love is guaranteed

[Hook]
So baby if you want me
You’ve got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, oh ah yeah
You’ve got to show me love

There’s nothing that you can tell me
You’ve got to show me love
There’s only one key to my heart
You’ve got to show me love"
917,A Whole New World,Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle,Peabo Bryson,A Whole New World Peabo Bryson,"I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be
A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me"

Sittin' over here, starin' in your face
With lust in my eyes, sure don't give a damn
And ya don't know that I've been dreamin'
Of ya in my fantasy
Never once you looked at me
Don't even realize that I'm wantin' you to fulfill my needs?
Think what you want, let your mind free
Run free to a place no one dares to

[Pre-Chorus]
How many nights I've laid in bed
Excited over you?
I've closed my eyes and thought of us
A hundred different ways

I wonder how 'bout you
Day and night, night and day

If I was your girl, oh, the things I'd do to you
I'd make you call out my name, I'd ask who it belongs to
If I was your woman, the things I'd do to you
But I'm not, so I can't, then I won't, but if I was your girl

Allow me some time to play with your mind
And you'll get there again and again
Close your eyes and imagine my body undressed
Take your time cause we've got all night, ooh
You on the rise as you're touchin' my thighs
And let me know what you like, if you like I'll go
Down, down, down, down, da, down, down
I'll hold you in my hand and maybe

Against my lips, sugar

A beam of light shining to the edge of the universe
It conquers all
It changes everything

They say it's a blessing
They say it's a gift
They say it's a miracle, and I believe that it is
It conquers all
But it's a mystery

Love breaks your heart
Love takes no less than everything
Love makes it hard
And fades away so easily

In this world we've created
In this place that we live
In a blink of an eye, baby, the darkness slips in
Love lights the world
Unites the lovers for eternity

Love breaks the chain
Love aches for every one of us
Love takes the tears and the pain
And turns it into the beauty that remains

I'll pray for love
I'll take my chances that it's not too late

921,Runaway Train,Soul Asylum,Soul Asylum,Runaway Train Soul Asylum,"Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep
There's no way out
This time I have really led myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mystery seems so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night
Earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
Runaway but it always seems the same"

Having a good time
With all your good time friends
I don't think that you think of me
You're on your own now
And I'm alone and free
I know that I should get on with my life
But a life lived without you could never be right

As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me

I try to smile so the hurt won't show
Tell everybody
That I was glad to see you go
But the tears just won't go away (won't go away)
Lonliness found me
Looks like it's here to stay
I know that I ought to find someone new
But all I find is myself always thinkin' of you

As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me

Oh... No matter what I do
Each night's a lifetime to live through
I can't go on like this. (I need your touch)
You're the only one I ever loved... oh

And as long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me
I'll never get over you gettin over
Never get over you... gettin over
I'll never get over you gettin' over me"
923,Ditty,Paperboy,Paperboy,Ditty Paperboy,"Yo, this is how I'm comin' for the nine deuce
Another phat, phat track, so Rhythm D, pour the orange juice
And let's relax while sippin' on 'gnac because it's like that
I'm cautious of hoes, so Paperboy wears prophylactic
I wear a jimmy for the skinny that's in the long trench
Front row seats, so yo I know she's on the nine inch
Just to get a piece of the green, but she's an undertaker
Not knowin' the paper is a 'round the world heart-breaker
Many say I front, but yo, had to have a break down
Playin' you fools, so now you know why my belly's round
Takin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, take me to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your woman, G
'Cause now that I'm rich so many women wanna do me
It make a man say 'damn'
I'm finally taxin' more than your homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is held up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this grip in ninety-two
And you don't bother me and I sure 'nuff won't bother you
And uh, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagara
Think before you step, because these lyrics just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold D's on my four and gold 'lex, 'cause I got it made
I broke the veto once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you
Just let me work this track, and yo, any way is OK
Your place or mine, all night until the next day, huh

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go from the top, second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, hoes should be happy for the ding-dong
And since a man clock a grip, G
It's like every nigga that I see be like, 'Do you remember me?'
A hustler, and it's known with more hoes than Lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so niggas leggo my Eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove
And pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, believe I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me with a chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up tokin'
So hide his eyes when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there, huh

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go, uh, let's take a trip to another land
Clock a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the Lex-o, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like 'What's up with ya? You ain't heard a damn thing'
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'Cause doin' the Ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Kick the kind of style that knock the funk off of Fritos
Make you man jealous while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the pipe with concern-and
I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And don't disagree and then jock, that's a pity
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the Ditty
Yeah

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you"

925,The River of Dreams,Billy Joel,Billy Joel,The River of Dreams Billy Joel,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep
I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep
And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep
I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind

In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep
We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

In the middle of the night

(Gloria, it's not Marie...)"

Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr.Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused

[Hook - Arrested Development]
Go ahead, Mr.Wendal
Go ahead, Mr.Wendal

[Verse 2 - Arrested Development]
Mr.Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr.Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall

[Hook - Arrested Development]
Mr.Wendal
Lord, Mr.Wendal"

On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly

I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Here today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Every one
Is my world, I will learn to survive
Any one
Is my world, I will learn to survive

Is my world

Talking 'bout them times when I was by myself
I would always be looking for somebody else
But, as time went on, I had a talk with my mind
Friends like you and you I gotta leave behind

[Chorus]
And so, you call me your friend
But you only want my ends
And I'll never see you if I had no loot (I'll never see them)
I'm just glad I know the truth
And I'm paying my own bills
And I'll never ever depend on you

[Verse 2]
Friends and enemies around me every day
I can't believe half the things they say
Taking me for granted giving no credit at all
I'll just keep bouncing like a bouncing ball
Everybody seems to disappear on me
Can't trust no one as far, as I can see
If I could be that fly that's on the wall
Listening to my friends talk about it all

You call me your friend
But you only want my ends

Well it’s another one, in the gutter one, ghetto running em
Troublesome, extra double dumb, I come to beat em
Defeat em and mistreat em, so what if that I’m cheating
Now everybody wanna sound grimey (yeah I know)
I’ma show ya how, come on, all in together now
Yeah oh yeah yeah that’s how it gotta be
So stop trying to be loud as me cause you can't do that
Think about it; playing Russian roulette with an automatic
I bet my ass against the line the last bullet’s first on line
Stab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild
Peace to the brothers on Rikers Isle
Tough enough and trembling, blend in like a chameleon
Buck, bye tough guy, oh my god I’m so high
Cause they say I rhyme, they say I look like a gremlin

I’m the nitty, nasty, gritty smashing, never slow gassing
Strictly swift blast of the raspy-rasp fashion
That I provide, I abide the U.S.G
Besides the ghetto vibe, make me flip like Jekyll and Hyde
Of course, I come across with the pure for sure unadulterated uncut raw
Disgusted, busted, you wanna touch it, too hot
You forgot, you’re not ready, your head could get ruptured
Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize
I supply the static, I run with the bad guys
The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters
See the big black picture if you look inside of my mind
It’s graphic, expressed it drastic
So kill the copycat act kid, it’s all mastered
Directed it, when y'all least expected it
And thought it was safe, Onyx hit you in the face so SLAM

I’m a b-boy, standing in my b-boy stance
Hurry up and give me the microphone before I bust in my pants
The mad author of anguish, my language polluted
Onyx is heavyweight and still undisputed
You took the words right out my mouth now walk a mile in my shoes
I paid so many dues, I feel used and abused and I’m so confused
*hiccup* Excuse me, for example I’m an inspiration of a whole generation
And unless you got ten sticky fingers it’s an imitation
A figment of your imagination
Bu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse
I’m not watered down so I’m dying of thirst
Coming through with a scam, foolproof plan
B-boys make some noise, and just, just SLAM

You said: ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo, PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like somethin' really big is missin'
Even though my name's graffiti-written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way

Ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day

From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found

Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us

Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof

I keep thinking about you, baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps dreaming of you
And it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough, yeah
Soon as I get you out my head
I'm in my car again, ooh, darling
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love, sugar
Once again

[Chorus]
Just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
Just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
Oh, babe

[Bridge]
Here come the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killing me, darling
Only takes one note I tell ya
From that radio
It's just another lonely love song

[Chorus]
It's just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy (You know you had me going)
Guess I'm all torn up (Going crazy, babe)
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
So sad
So sad, so sad
So sad, sad love song
Ooh I heard it on the radio last night
So sad
So sad, so sad
So sad, sad love song
Ooh, you got me singing another love song all night

[Chorus]
It's just another sad love song
Racking my brain like crazy
Ooh and I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
Ooh and it's all because of you

So sad

So sad, sad love song
And it's all because of you

Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend

Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Verse 2]
Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?

But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

[Verse 3]
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's
Got a role for me
I'm so confused
Will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there)

(Lead me)
(Love me and feed me)
(Kiss me and free me)

In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart"

He cast a shadow on your heart, and I will bring back your light

Come in, I see he's hurt you again
When you are in pain, I'm in pain, that's part of being a friend
But this is a special case, I held my feelings back because of him
And now I can see it more than ever, I made a very big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mean to disregard your feelings, but I think he's a fool
He don't know how sensitive you are, and baby that just ain't cool
I'm just glad I can be there for you, when you need a helping hand
Deep inside my heart from the start, I know I should've been your man

Lay down, and tell me what's on your mind
What exactly did he do, to make you cry this time?

Don't even respect your ass
That's why it's time for the doctor to check your ass, nigga
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Now I wanna slap the taste out ya mouth
Make ya bow down to the Row
Fuckin' me, now I'm fuckin' you, little ho
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'mma talk on
Stomping on the Eazy-est streets that you can't walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key

You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck with you

Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

[Verse 2]
Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died

Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
But you know that don't
Mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

You can sing most anything

Round and round and round you go
When you find love you'll always know

977,It Was a Good Day,Ice Cube,Ice Cube,It Was a Good Day Ice Cube,"[Produced by DJ Pooh]

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another 24?""
I gotta go, ‘cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
‘Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp""
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Half way home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day

[Outro]
Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?"

We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Them they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids
Us floor rush when the DJ's booming classics
You, dig the crew on the fattest hip-hop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin' chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock

But

He gives the strangest smile so I say hi (wassup)

How to consume or they'll be just like juice
If it's the shit we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic, Hip hop gains a classic

She sweats the beat and ask me cause she puffed it
Me I got crew kids seven and a crescent
Us cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him, that's my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn nine-pigs
The rebirth of slick like my gangsta stroll

Now he boogies up your stage plaits twist or braids

Tears for fears (are no surprise)
Happens almost every time

Love 'em and leave 'em (is the rule of most dogs)
You must be strong
Stand up on your own
Take control of your life

It's not worth it, no
Don't be down and miserable
You and only you
Can bring yourself around

Fact of life (so sad but true)
Love can often hurt you
Leaving scars most of your life (nightmares can haunt you)
But fairytales of love can come true
Both play tricks on your mind
(You'll be fine, take this time to find piece of mind)
Sooner or later (bad feelings will die)
You must be strong
Don't blame it all on love
In time good things will come

The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
Went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis
(Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, see...)
The bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school, and I passed
No moms trippin', so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac
I says ""I am what I am, that's who I be""
And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids try to be like me...
(With the braids, the shades, some pants and some Nikes, G)
And nothin' mo' better then a letter sayin'
""I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?"" Yesssss!
I try to pass 'em my autograph
I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood
Ain't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good
Cause I'm down like four flat tires
(Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj)
Showin' I can do right and not do wrong
Representin BG's and comin' up strong, and...
(We ain't got no love for the side)
We only love those who love us back, right?

Hold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...

Tell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight
Say hold tight, tight and everyting is alright

[Verse 3: Mac Daddy]
Now people seem to think what I do is a blast
Cause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know, really d'know
The pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz
Early mornin' interviews then we step to school
Step from school, back to interviews then it's on to other dues
So, warm it up Chris?
I said ""Ya warm it up Chris?""
That's what I was born to do!

[Verse 4: Daddy Mac]
Now throw your hands in the air and wave from side-to-side
If the feelin' thatcha feelin', is the feelin' of pride
See, I ain't come out wack I came out right
Unlike those moles who tried to ""Pass Da Mic""
It's the Daddy Mac (Big baby!)
Everything is real but you wanna diss cause a nigga sold a couple mill
(Look here...) Ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line
So when you diss it just lets me know I'm on your mind, and it's alright

Makes it easy to give
Never think about myself

Break it down again
So those are my dreams
And these are my eyes
Stand tall like a man
Headstrong like a horse

When it's all mixed up
Better break it down

In the world of secrets
In the world of sound

It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
See for yourself you have been sitting on a time bomb
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new about you and your inner song
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground
(Break it down again)
I want to break it down
(Break it down again)

Break it down again
So those are my schemes
And these are my plans
Hot tips for the boys
Fresh news from the force

When it's all mixed up
Better break it down

In the world of silence
In the world of sound

""No sleep for dreaming"" say the architects of life
Big bouncing babies, bread and butter can I have a slice
They make no mention of the beauty of decay
Blue, yellow, pink umbrella save it for a rainy day
And all the love and all the love in the world
Won't stop the rain from falling
Waste seeping underground
(Break it down again)
I want to break it down
(Break it down again)

Horsin' around
Pray to the power
Play to the crowd with your big hit sound
And they won't simmer, won't simmer, won't simmer down
Play to the crowd
Play to the crowd
Play yeah yeah

It's in the way you're always hiding from the light
Fast off to heaven just like Moses on a motorbike
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else
Could show you something new to help you
With the ups and downs
(Break it down again)
I want to break it down
(Break it down again)
Break it down again
(Break it down again)
(Break it down again)
Here we go!

Break it down again
No more sleepy dreaming
No more building up
It is time to dissolve
Break it down it again
No more sleepy dreaming"

992,Three Little Pigs,Green Jelly,Green Jelly,Three Little Pigs Green Jelly,"(Spoken)
Why don't you, sit right back
And I, I may tell you, a tale
A tale of three, little pigs
And a big, bad, wolfff

Well the first little piggy, well he was kinda hip
He spent most of his days, just a dreamin of the city
And then one day, he bought a guitar
He moved to Hollywood, to become a star
But, living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city
Built his house out of straw, what a pity
And then one day, jammin on some chords
Along came the wolf, knocking on his door

[Chorus:]
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!
Well I'm huffin, I'm puffin, I'll blow your house in
Huffin, puffin, blow your house in
Huffin, puffin, blow your house in
Huffin and a puffin and I'll blow your house in!!!

Well the second little piggy, well he was kinda stoked
He spent most of his time just a ganga smokin
Huffin and a puffin down on Venice Beach
Getting paid money for religious speech
He built his shelter from what he garbage picked
Mostly made up of old cans and sticks
Then one day he was cranking out Bob Marley
And along came the Wolf on his big bad Harley

[Chorus:]
Well the third little piggy, the grade A student
His daddy was a rock star, named Pig Nugent
Earned his Masters Degree, from Harvard College
Built his house from his architect knowledge
A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills
Daddy's rock stardom, paid for the bills
And then one day came the old house smasher
The big bad wolf the little piggy slasher

[Chorus:]
Well the big bad Wolf
Well he huffed, and he puffed, all that he could
And low and behold the little piggy's house stood
""IT'S MADE OUT OF CONCRETE!"" the little piggy shouted
The wolf just frowned, as he pouted
So they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would
The sent out rambo, just as fast, as they could

(Rambo)
""YO, WOLF-FACE, I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE, YOUR ASS IS MINE!!!""

(gunshots)

Well the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see
So that's to end the story, for you and me
If you still give a listen, you just may, here a big wolf or little piggy
Say

(Chorus [a little different])
"" And the moral of the story is, ' A band with no talent can easily amuse
Idiots, with a stupid, puppet show. """

I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough

Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream (that's right)

If you open up the gates for me

Try to black it out, but it plays again

Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life after death

[Intro]
(TrapXFicante)
Cuando me des la mano no me sueltes
Recuerda no corro ya con la misma suerte
No sé si después yo podré volver a verte
Quisiera siempre estar contigo y por nada del mundo perderte (Skrt, skrt)

[Pre-Coro]
Y que se prenda en fuego la habitación
Hazme el amor con ganas y con pasión

[Coro]
Tú no sabes si mañana me muero
Y si estar contigo aquí es mi último deseo
Recuerda siempre lo mucho que te quiero
Recuerdalo

Que tú no sabes si mañana me muero
Si estar contigo aquí es mi ultimo deseo
Recuerda siempre lo mucho que te quiero
Recuerdalo

[Verso 1]
(Yeah, Farru!)
Házmelo rico, bebé, yeah
Imagina que es la última vez, girl
Que tú no me vas a volver a ver (Mira, mírame)
Y uno no sabe cuándo se va a morir

Te quiero encender, encima de mí
Bien rico, bebé, me hago dueño de tu piel
Abrázame, ven tócame
No me sueltes, bebé

[Pre-Coro]
Y que se prenda en fuego la habitación
Hazme el amor con ganas y con pasión

[Coro]
Tú no sabes si mañana me muero
Y si estar contigo aquí es mi último deseo
Recuerda siempre lo mucho que te quiero
Recuerdalo

Que tú no sabes si mañana me muero
Si estar contigo aquí es mi ultimo deseo
Recuerda siempre lo mucho que te quiero
Recuerdalo

[Verso 2]
Dime si me amas, que será tarde mañana
Ven y házmelo ahora, antes que se me vire un pana
Mírame a la cara y dime si no sientes nada
Si supieras que yo quiero hacerlo como la semana pasada

De nuevo quiero verte, agarrarte por el pelo y los labios morderte
Hay cosas que yo siempre quise y no pude hacerte
Dios bendiga tu suerte, y que a mi puerta no toque la muerte
Lo último que quisiera en la vida sería, amor, perderte

[Outro]
Y cuando me des la mano no me sueltes
Recuerda no corro ya con la misma suerte
No sé si después yo podré volver a verte
Quisiera siempre estar contigo y por nada del mundo perderte

(Y que se prenda en fuego)
Yeah, Farru!
(Hazme el amor con ganas)

If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be?

Oh, I, I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul and if you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything good in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

Without you there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me

And I, baby, I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you, if you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now

How do I live without you? I want to know
How do I breathe without you if you ever go?
How do I ever, ever survive?
How do I, how do I, oh, how do I live?

Please, tell me, baby
How do I go on if you ever leave?
Baby, you would take away everything, I need you with me

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with

[Verse 1: Usher]
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you
How you make me wanna...

Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Verse 2: Usher]
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Verse 3: Usher]
At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

[Bridge]
I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway

Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it level up
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, ""There go Mase!"", there go your cutie

Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, rip all the spots
Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now, ""When all the ballin' stops?""
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A. be on your way
‘Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square

Tap my cell and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's ‘cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that!
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at? Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player please
Lyrically, niggas see B.I.G be flossin’
Jig on the cover of Fortune, 5 double O
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat

When I was young, I knew everything
And she, a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt-stricken, sobbin' with my head on the floor
Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no

[Chorus]
Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise
And we'd never compromise?
For the life of me, I cannot believe
We'd ever die for these sins, we were merely freshmen

My best friend took a week's vacation to forget her
His girl took a week's worth of valium and slept
And now he's guilt-stricken, sobbin' with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said

""Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place""

For the life of me, I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise
And we'd never compromise?

We tried to wash our hands of all of this
We'd never talk of our lacking relationships
And how we're guilt-stricken sobbin' with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say

""Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
And I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place""

Anytime I need to see your face
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter
In the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola
I don't even try to explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again
I might move so slightly
To the arms
And the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to I want to...

Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out

[Verse 2]
I'm the kind of person
Who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect
Is what I live for
But a look and then
A smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction
Of a lover and a mate
But the time of talking
Using symbols, using words
Can be likened
To a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

Ooh I want you

Ooh I'd die to find out
Ooh I want you
I don't know if I need you but
Ooh I'd die to find out

I put hoes in NY onto DKNY
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace
All Philly hoes go with Moschino
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie?
Meaning, who's really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
""Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement""
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me

So, get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly
Hit 'em with the force like Obi

I long for the warmth of days gone by
When you were mine
But now those days are memories in time
Life's empty without you by my side
My heart belongs to you
No matter what I try

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
When I get the courage up to love somebody new
It always falls apart cause they just can't compare to you
Your love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean
Where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves
The trees are bare when you're not here
It doesn't feel the same
(It doesn't feel the same, oh)

[Verse 2: Nathan (Mike)]
Remember the nights
When we closed our eyes (we closed our eyes)
And vowed that you and I
Would be in love for all time

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
Everytime I think about these things I shared with you
I break down and cry cause I get so emotional
Until you release me I'm bound under ball and chain
Reminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here It doesn't feel the same

[Bridge: Wanya (Mike)]
This loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)
Please let me love again

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]
Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain
Or four seasons will bring the loneliness again

[Chorus]
In comes the winter breeze
That chills the air and drifts the snow
And I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe
When springtime makes its way here
Lilac blooms reminds me of
The scent of your perfume
When summer burns with heat
I always get the hots for you
Go skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do
When autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare
When you're not here

Oh you get me ready
In your '56 Chevy
Why don't we go sit down in the shade
Take shelter on my front porch
The dandelion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade

I will do the laundry
If you pay all the bills
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone

Why don't you stay the evening
Kick back and watch the T.V
And I'll fix a little something to eat
Ohh I know your back hurts
From working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee my sweet

I will raise the children
If you pay all the bills
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone

I am wearing my new dress tonight
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes

We finally sell the Chevy
When we had another baby
And you took that job in Tennessee
You made friends at the farm
And you join them at the bar
Almost every single day of the week

I will wash the dishes
While you go have a beer
Where is my John Wayne
Where is my prairie song
Where is my happy ending
Where have all the cowboys gone
Where is my Marlboro Man
Where is his shiny gun
Where is my lonely ranger
Where have all the cowboys gone?"

Wait to tell all your friends

He'll hold you close when
You're makin' love
He's everything

Lookin' deep into mine

Any words could say
But you don't even know I'm alive
Baby to you all I am
Is the invisible man

You probably spend
Hours on the phone
Talkin' 'bout nothing at all
It doesn't matter
What the conversation
Just as long as he called
Lost in a love so real
And so sincere
You wipe away each other's tears
Your face lights up
Whenever he appears

The way you look at him

I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny and Rémy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind it
Felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
He used to, pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep, I took the keys to the Jeep
Tell him, ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, ho hop
Raw top in my man's drop
Then this homie Jimmy, he's screamin', ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanels, kept me out nice
Called suckin' his dick, ""rockin' the mic""
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
The motherfucker never ate my pussy

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

[Verse 2]
I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush & Avenue U
Had a weed spot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't tap
I used to see him, in The Tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he wanna get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four-stroke creep
I jumped on the dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin'""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
""I'll pass, nigga, the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double glass
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown, taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your 5 G stones
I give you 10 G's, nigga, if ya leave me alone,"" screamin'

Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right

The moral of the story is this:
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double-digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front
For limp-dick niggas, that's frontin' like they willy
Suck my pussy till they kill me, you feel me?

[Chorus]
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight
Eat my pussy right
I don't want dick tonight"

And when I see you, bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double-time

I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Living alone
I think of all the friends I have known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

Don't wanna be
All by myself

All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself

There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

[Chorus]
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 2]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby Baby

[Chorus]
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

[Verse 3]
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

[Chorus]
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 4]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, Baby, Baby

[Chorus]
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

[Chorus]
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now

Wanna gimme the cash he made off his last bundle
Nasty girl, don't pass me the world

Don't deepthroat for c-notes, she floats
Murder she wrote and keeps the heat close
Firm nigga, we 'posed to be the illest on three coasts
Familia, bigger than Icos

Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo
And Benny Goodman's corset and pen

I promised you I'd never give up

I come round, around the hard way
Bring you comics in bed, scrape the mold off the bread
And serve you french toast again

Well, O.K. I still get stoned
I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home

Up in the cut like gay niggas, in butt

I cut with razor blades, play spades with Aunt Venus
Evaluate this rap, take heed a fuckin' genius
Up in the sky, up high don't puff lye
Do you smoke crack Sam, prepare to fuckin' die

You thought I had eight but I got ten more
Off beat and on beat, old school like Beat Street
I stink like Pop's feet, make sweat with no heat

I'm up on this track, like Pam Grier in movies
I heats up the beat, like water in a jacuzzi
I fly to L.A., then come back to Virginia
Then call Maganoo to see if he's got some indo
Then back to the crib to pick up my brother, G
G don't forget to bring the house keys
Hops in the eight, five-oh now here we go
Please, please brother don't slam my car door

Don't have no time for the shucking and jiving
Peep my rhyme cause that shit's off-timing

No fan of Madonna, she just a damn slut
So sit you damn dog and bow to my shit

Been making more beats before Jehovah had Witness
Up jumps da boogie, boogie jumps me

See a White man scared, from a Black man's power
Back to reality

Now I cold rock a party in a b-girl stance
I rock on the floor make the fellas wanna dance
I be the shit and it's all good and if you understood

[Verse 1]
Would you stop scheming and trying to look hard
I get my bodyguard, You get that booty scarred
I'm a veteran, which means that I've been
In the game too long, since the days of Paper Thin
Way back when I've been putting it down
Ask your homies who's the baddest bitch on this side of town
I flow like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Spectacular over M-I-C
I go for broke, never giving it less than the best
Lots of years in the game at your request
You like the rhyme, bite if you dare
I get the paper so I don't care
Fly that's me; the epitomy
Of what a real MC is supposed to be
Fucking you up every time that I drop
I fuck a bullet baby, I done took your spot
I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look, it ain't hard to tell that I

Back off me and let my skin breathe, Lyte is everlasting
It's hard to believe I shall prevail cause I'm next to none
Cause I'm claiming no set, Don't plan to get down
Just Brooklyn is where I'm from
But I'm resting in Studio City for the fun
If you don't understand then say you don't (nah!)
And don't wait for me to explain cause I won't
You see it's in my nature to be the best (say what?)
West to East, see East to West
Ready or not I have arrived and I'm live
Showing an MC how to survive
Cause it's crazy how I get you captured with my tactics
I got many witnesses that can back this
Ruffnecks, from New York to L.A
Been down with me since Poor George
It's '96 -- it's all about show and prove and I'm about to
Make the ill type moves, I guide the beat and I ride it well
And if you take a look it ain't hard to tell that I

Get out my shit, please let me be
I don't see why, you KGB
Why you gotta be all up on me like that

And the shit don't stop
It goes on, on, on, on
You see, the shit don't stop till the break of dawn
And now who makes it liver than a hip-hop, scuba diver
Chilling with
A pina colada, kidada hooked me up
With Tommy now I got a lot of gear
From everywhere, that I'd like to share (yeah right!)
But I'd rather do Kani, don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done

Just tell me what you've got to say to me
I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth
It comes as no surprise at all you see
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through
Now I know your heart, I know your mind
You don't even know you're being unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
Boy, you can't play me that way

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

When I saw my best friend yesterday
She said she never liked you from the start
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming, handsome man
Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes
I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way

Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

How we need a place where we can go
A land where every one will have a hero (even me)

You told me secrets that, you've never told a soul
You were so nervous and, yet oh so comfortable
As we explored your image of love
I drank your wine, as you taste mine
I kissed your lips, you felt my body slip
Into your soul
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

I was inside of you (Inside of you)

Last night, there was no planning it
It was so special and, so very innocent
We talked of memories, our favorite fantasies
As we explored our visions of love
Deep in the night, right by the fireside
You felt my candlelight, in your soul
You felt incredible, I started to explode
I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

What's the deal
I wanna know is this love for real
Or could it be lust that I feel
You got it going on and on like a real fly sex appeal
Physique extra ill sun sweet dress to kill
You got me open like token hot and smokin
Jacuzzi bubble bath laughin joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight beach sand white listen
Seafood dishes wine cooler champagne wishes waterbed head
Fine do with some riches
Our loveable hugeable I love the cute
As long as I'm around and down nothin could ever trouble you

Chorus:

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy

..... I spend quality time
Cute face haircut like the Hally design
Keep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up
Shop till you drop cause the cream dont stop
Buy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot
So she could look good for Hev D
Overweight loving MC rub you gently
You know its C big CEO sex-o-pee

You might feelme creeping to your room late at night
It's hell a waterbed so get it right

Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Our lifestyles be close-captioned, addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!

Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!

Won't you smile? Just smile

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Fuck the world, as we elope and witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is ""Fuck friends!"" – we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga

[Bridge: Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

T'es déjà trentenaire, on s'envoie en l'air
Mais j'ai qu'la vingtaine, donc j'ai qu'ça à faire
Me parle pas de mariage, j'te fais perdre ton temps
Mais qu'est-ce que c'est bon
Quand j'p'lote tes implants
J'me sens comme avant
Comme quand j'en avais rien à battre
Je suis jeune, j'm'en fous de l'avenir
De ce que notre relation va devenir
Mais pour lui ce n'est pas le cas, il a d'jà un taf
Il fait le mec mature
Mais tu sais qu'au lit, plus que lui j'assure
Rappelle-toi quand t'avais des courbatures
J't'avais bien niqué ta race
Rappelle-toi bien de la suite
Dans les hôtels et les suites
J't'invitais aux soirées V.I.P
À la télé tu regardais mes clips
On l'a fait sans autotune
Sur une prod de Twinsmatic
C'est ma manière romantique de dire
Que je n'avais pas mis de préservatif

J'vais pas trop m'étaler, saigner fallait, blessé j'l'étais
J't'ai remballé, tu m'as remplacé, tu m'as délaissé
Mais comme tout salaud, j't'ai téléphoné, j't'ai récupéré
Puis j't'ai fait pleurer parce que j'en ai rien à foutre
C'est ça la life (ouais)
Qu'est-ce qu'tu croyais ?
Tu baises avec moi, tu baises avec d'autres
Même si j'fais pareil, c'est pas la même chose
Ben oui et non, moi j'ai besoin de ma dose, ma libido
Et casse pas les yeuks, fais pas celle qui réplique

I shot the sheriff
--Chorus--

Verse One:

I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
He mistaked me for somebody who was liable
To more than many murders
LA's a war fields
We keep making war shields
Streets keep souls
Young brothers lose control
I seem to maintain through this
Watch where you kick it they'll put you in a twist
And it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie
And tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
They do crime and attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

--Chorus--

Verse Two:

They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do
You know who
The boys in blue
There they go with they assumpitons
Slaverys over let us have somethin'
Why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
My profession is music
Your profession is protection with gats

Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

--Chorus--

Verse Three:

I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you
And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
They harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
The hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
Cuz I'm gonna work for life
So he can see another day
A hommies a hommie
A fake is a snake
Straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in"

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, excuse me mister but can you please turn down the lights?
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga

[Verse: Tyler, The Creator]
I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego here so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school? (Ha, I'm in my own school)
And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named the album Cherry Bomb because Greatest Hits sounded boring
I don't like to follow the rules, she said that I must
I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk who's in charge of this Golf shit
I said ""Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant""
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick
It's young T

[Bridge]
I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand
And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand
Better pose for that camera
Better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action
Now you're face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life

[Outro]
Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips high-five my tongue
Fingers moonwalk through your hair
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp
(Lights, and the camera, and the action)
You should be mine in a way tonight

1086,Don't Cry for Me Argentina,Madonna,Madonna,Don't Cry for Me Argentina Madonna,"[Verse 1:]
It won't be easy, you'll think it strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus:]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Verse 2:]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They are not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus:]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know
That every word is true"

You had me stuck off the realness, fearless
The head was sick, I call that mental illness
Maybe I'm crazy, singing to myself
Looking in the mirror, pointing fingers at myself
Here was you, living off me
Smoking loud, speaking softly
Now I'm in the car, singing off-key like:
""I'm just saying you can do better""
I'm heated, I can't say that I'm chilling
Ain't feeling what you say if you won't say what you're feeling now
Take the words back and think them through
The songs on the radio might be about you

[Verse 1: Cassie]
Why am I thinking of you after all you've done
Why's my heart fighting for you when my mind wants you gone
Held on for too long, oh, oh, oh
I've heard it before, I'm singing the same old story now

When I used to hear from SWV and En Vogue
Mary J. Blige all wrote a song about you
It seems that you're old news, and now I wrote one too
I should have learned about guys like you...

[Chorus]
On the radio
When the DJ used to play what I thought was my favorite song
Who knew that they were trying to tell me about you
And the crazy things you do
How could you be so cruel
And now I wrote a song that's on the radio
And I'm sure that this will someone's favorite song
I hope she knows I'm trying to tell her about you
And the crazy things you do
I know you we don't seem that crude
But you can learn from the songs on the radio

[Verse 2: Cassie]
Now I'm sitting here listening to all those old songs
Crazy they're talking about you and I just sing along
How did I go wrong, oh, oh, oh
They gave me the sign but I didn't listen to 'em no

I used to hear songs from TLC and Destiny's Child too
Xscape and Total had a couple songs about you
Seems that you're old news, now I wrote one too
I should have learned from all the songs...

[Chorus]
On the radio
When the DJ used to play what I thought was my favorite song
Who knew that they were trying to tell me about you
And the crazy things you do
How could you be so cruel
And now I wrote a song that's on the radio
And I'm sure that this will someone's favorite song
I hope she knows I'm trying to tell her about you
And the crazy things you do
I know you we don't seem that crude
But you can learn from the songs on the radio

[Bridge]
I call the request line to ask the DJ how soon would be the next time
That I can expect you to play what I like
The song of my life, at least for tonight
I wanna hear it...

[Chorus]

When the DJ used to play what I thought was my favorite song
Who knew that they were trying to tell me about you
And the crazy things you do
How could you be so cruel

1088,Go the Distance,Michael Bolton,Michael Bolton,Go the Distance Michael Bolton,"I have often dreamed, of a far-off place
Where a hero's welcome, would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps sayin', ""This is where I'm meant to be.""

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way, if I can be strong
I know every mile, will be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong

Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate
Though the road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years, would be worth the wait
It may take a lifetime, but somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope, but I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms

I will search the world, I will face its harms
Till I find my hero's welcome, waiting in your arms"

For little money just tips for pay

Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies
He turned to me as if to say

I'd never make you feel like that, cause...

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

I need love, love
Ooh, ease my mind
And I need to find time
Someone to call mine;

[Chorus]
My mama said, ""You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait""
She said, ""Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take""
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes

[Verse 1]
How many heartaches must I stand
Before I find the love to let me live again
Right now the only thing that keeps me hanging on
When I feel my strength, ooh, it's almost gone

[Chorus]
I remember mama said, ""You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait""
She said, ""Love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take""
How long must I wait
How much more must I take
Before loneliness
Will cause my heart, heart to break

[Verse 2]
No, I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
Well these precious words keep me hanging on

[Chorus]
I remember mama said, ""You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait""
She said, ""Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take""
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
Just trust in a good time
No matter how long it takes

[Verse 3]
Now love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
Hold me tight
I keep waiting
Ooh, till that day
But it ain't easy (Love don't come easy)
No, you know it ain't easy

[Outro]
My mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said ""Love don't come easy
But it's a game of give and take""
You can't hurry love
No, you'll just have to wait
She said ""Love don't come easy

Here we stand
Worlds apart
Hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground
I am reaching for you, you, you

Feeling that it's gone
Cannot change your mind
If we cannot go on
To survive the tide
Love divides

[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched
And went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love will not desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched
And went our separate ways

[Verse 2]
Troubled times
Caught between confusions and pain, pain, pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain
In vain, vain

If you must go
I wish you love
You will never walk alone
Take care my love
Miss you love

[Chorus]
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched
And went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched
And went our separate ways

[Instrumental Interlude]

Oooooooooh
Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you

I still love you, girl
I really love you, girl
And if he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
Nooooooooo
Nooooooooo"

1142,Allentown,Billy Joel,Billy Joel,Allentown Billy Joel,"Well we're living here in Allentown
And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line

Well our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in Allentown

But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to stay

Well we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved

So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron and coke
And chromium steel
And we're waiting here in Allentown

But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled away

Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face

Well I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down
But I won't be getting up today

And it's getting very hard to stay
And we're living here in Allentown"

Said no to him...again and again
First he took my heart...and then he ran

No one knows how I feel
What I said unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand...take me home

Stand back...stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright...it's alright
To be standing in a line
(Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I cry...

Do not turn away my friend
Like a willow I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came

So I walked on down away from you
Maybe your attention was more
Than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love
And that was all

Stand back...stand back
In the middle of my room
I did not hear from you
It's alright...it's alright
To be standing in a line

Away from you
Maybe your attention was more

1144,Tell Her About It,Billy Joel,Billy Joel,Tell Her About It Billy Joel,"Listen boy don't want to see you
Let a good thing slip away
You know I don't like watching anybody make
The same mistakes I made
She's a real nice girl
And she's always there for you
But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do

Listen boy I'm sure that you think
You got it all under control
You don't want somebody telling you
The way to stay in someone's soul
You're a big boy now
And you'll never let her go
But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know

[Chorus 1]
Tell her about it
Tell her everything you feel
Give her every reason to accept
That you're for real
Tell her about it
Tell her all your crazy dreams
Let her know you need her
Let her know how much she means

Listen boy it's not automatically
A certain guarantee
To insure yourself you've got to provide
Communication constantly
When you love someone
You're always insecure
And there's only one good way to reassure

Tell her about it
Let her know how much you care
When she can't be with you
Tell her you wish you were there
Tell her about it
Every day before you leave
Pay her some attention
Give her something to believe

Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
Just because you haven't spoken for so long
Though you may not have done anything
Will that be a consolation when she's gone

Listen boy it's good information
From a man who's made mistakes
Just a word or two that she gets from you
Could be the difference that it makes
She's a trusting soul
She's put her trust in you
But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do

I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be all right
Perhaps it's just imagination

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep

The smell of your skin can
Light up all the fires in me

Hungry to touch
I'm eager to please
Out of control
And I hand you the keys
Every night I am burning
To make love to you

But don't try to tell me
You think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that

You ought to know
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart

When we make love
It's a passionate thing
You shudder and shake
Sink your teeth in my skin
I almost believe you were made
To be played by my hands

And you got the power
It amazes me still
How you play my emotions
With consummate skill
I don't have to look any further
Than into your eyes

So don't try to tell me
You think it's just physical
It goes way deeper than that

You better know
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart

I'm the controller
And I want to touch you and seize you
And make you mine, hey, hey

Tell me about the plans you're makin'
Then tell me one thing more before I go

Tell me how am supposed to live without you
Now that I've been lovin' you so long
How am I supposed to live without you
How am I supposed to carry on
When all that I've been livin 'for is gone

I didn't come here for cryin'
Didn't come here to breakdown
It's just a dream of mine is coming to an end
And how can I blame you

I'm gonna pay for dreaming
When even now it's more than I can take"

Where the supermarket used to stand
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local Palais
That's where the big bands used to come and play
My sister went there on a Saturday

Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing?
It's only natural

Another Saturday, another date
She would be ready but she's always make them wait
In the hallway in anticipation
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek

Come dancing
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing
My sister always did

My sister should have come in a midnight
And my mum would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late
Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate

The day they knocked down the Palais
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the Palais
Part of my childhood died, just died

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the Palais used to stand
My sister's married and she lives on an estate
Her daughters go out now it's her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her I wonder if she would

Come dancing
Come on sister have yourself a ball
Don't be afraid to come dancing
It's only natural

Come dancing
Just like the Palais on a Saturday
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play"

1169,All Right,Christopher Cross,Christopher Cross,All Right Christopher Cross,"I know
I know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes
But you can give it one more try

Find a reason why
You should pick it up
Oooh, and try it again

Cause it's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for me

I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more
But this time
This time things seem just a little different

And when I look in your eyes
You know I can see that it's true
And I hear you say

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
Cause it's not too late for that
Too late for love

Just when you feel helpless
Nothing left to say
Love will find us, the past behind us
Then we're on our way

Time and time again I see
People so unsure like me
We all know it gets hard sometimes

You can give it one more try
Find another reason why
You should pick it up
Oooh, you should kick it up
Oooh, and try it again

Cause it's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time

It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It's all right, I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time"

I could start dreamin' but it never ends
As long as you're gone we may as well pretend
I've been dreamin'
Straight from the heart

You say it's easy but who's to say
That we'd be able to keep it this way
But it's easier
Comin' straight from the heart

Oh Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make another start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

I see you on the street some other time
And all my words would just fall out of line
While we're dreamin'
Straight from the heart

Oh Give it to me straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go - as long as I know
It's comin' straight from the heart

{Bridge}

Oh
Don't ever leave me darlin'

Oh straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go- as long as I know
You'll give it to me now
Straight from the heart
Tell me we can make one more start
You know I'll never go-as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart
Give it to me
Oh no, oh no
Straight from the heart
You know I'll never go-as long as I know
It's coming straight from the heart"

When you can't give love
You give alibis

There comes a time
Mama, when you gotta do right

People say that love will grow
So how was I to know
Love that's come
Through years and years
Can't find a way
Back home anymore

Tell me the truth
Don't turn away

Touch each other's heart

1175,It's a Mistake,Men at Work,Men at,It's a Mistake Men at,"Jump down the shelters to get away
The boys are cockin' up their guns
Tell us general, is it party time?
If it is can we all come

Don't think that we don't know
Don't think that we're not trying
Don't think we move too slow
It's no use after crying
Saying

It's a mistake, it's a mistake
It's a mistake, it's a mistake

After the laughter as died away
And all the boys have had their fun
No surface noise now, not much to say
They've got the bad guys on the run

Don't try to say you're sorry
Don't say he drew his gun
They've gone and grabbed old Ronnie
He's not the only one saying

It's a mistake, it's a mistake
It's a mistake, it's a mistake

Tell us commander, what do you think?
'Cos we know that you love all that power
Is it on then, are we on the brink?
We wish you'd all throw in the towel

We'll not fade out too soon
Not in this finest hour
Whistle your favourite tune
We'll send a card and flower

It's a mistake, it's a mistake
It's a mistake, it's a mistake"

Which paces in my head
It's nothing that you do to me

Highway run into the midnight sun
Wheels go round and round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sending all my love along the wire

They say that the road ain't no place to start a family

I'm forever yours...faithfully

Circus life under the big top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show
Wondering where I am, lost without you

Two strangers learn to fall in love again
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours...faithfully
